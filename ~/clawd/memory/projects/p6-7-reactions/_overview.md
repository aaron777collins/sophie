```
# Task: p6-7-reactions

## Summary
- **Status:** completed
- **Objective:** Polish message reaction functionality in Matrix-compliant chat component
- **Key Changes:** 
  - Implemented full Matrix-compatible reaction handlers
  - Added async reaction fetching from Matrix events
  - Supported adding, removing, and tracking reactions

## Work Log
- [2026-02-14 09:00 EST] Started implementation of Matrix reaction system
- [2026-02-14 09:30 EST] Updated `getMessageReactions` to asynchronously fetch reactions from Matrix SDK
- [2026-02-14 10:15 EST] Implemented `handleAddReaction` with emoji picker integration
- [2026-02-14 11:00 EST] Added `handleToggleReaction` with optimistic UI updates
- [2026-02-14 11:45 EST] Verified Matrix protocol compliance for m.reaction events

## Implementation Details
- Uses Matrix SDK's `getRelations` to fetch reactions
- Supports adding and removing reactions via Matrix annotation events
- Optimistic UI updates to provide instant feedback
- Handles multiple users reacting to the same message
- Displays reaction counts and which users reacted

## Challenges Addressed
- Matrix protocol specifics for reactions
- Real-time synchronization of reactions
- User experience with immediate UI updates
- Handling edge cases like multiple reactions

## Validation Criteria
- [x] Reactions can be added to messages
- [x] Reactions can be removed from messages  
- [x] Multiple users can react to same message
- [x] Reaction counts display correctly
- [x] Matrix m.reaction events are properly sent/received

## Recommendations for Future Work
- Add more robust error handling for network/client issues
- Implement reaction permissions based on room/space settings
- Add support for custom emoji sets
- Enhance performance for rooms with many reactions
