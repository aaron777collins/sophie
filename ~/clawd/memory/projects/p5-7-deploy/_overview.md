```
# HAOS v2 Deployment to dev2 (Phase 5 Voice/Video)

## Deployment Status: INCOMPLETE

### Deployment Challenges
- Docker container `haos-v2` failed to start
- Potential issues with:
  1. Environment variables
  2. Docker configuration
  3. Build dependencies

### Required Next Steps
1. Check docker-compose.yml for any configuration errors
2. Verify all required environment variables are set
3. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
4. Manually review build and startup logs

### Detailed Investigation Needed
- Verify LiveKit configuration
- Check network and port mappings
- Confirm all required services are configured

### Recommendations
- Review deployment script in `/scripts/deploy-dev2.sh`
- Manually run docker build and docker run to diagnose issues
- Validate environment-specific configurations

## Recommended Actions
1. SSH into dev2
2. Navigate to ~/haos-v2
3. Run `docker-compose build` with verbose output
4. Run `docker-compose up` and capture full logs
5. Investigate any startup or configuration errors

## Notification Status
⚠️ FAILED to send Slack notification due to channel configuration issue. 
Manual notification recommended.
