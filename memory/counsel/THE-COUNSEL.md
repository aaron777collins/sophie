# The Council: Decision Tracking Process

## Purpose
This document outlines the systematic approach to tracking and documenting strategic decisions made by the Council.

## Decision Logging Workflow

### 1. Pre-Meeting Preparation
- Identify potential strategic decisions
- Collect background information and context
- Prepare decision template in advance

### 2. During Council Meeting
- Discuss and debate the decision
- Capture key points of discussion
- Ensure all perspectives are considered

### 3. Decision Documentation
When a decision is made, immediately log it in `memory/counsel/INDEX.md`:

#### Decision Logging Checklist
- [ ] Assign a unique Decision ID (YYYY-MM-DD-unique-identifier)
- [ ] Categorize the decision
- [ ] Document full context
- [ ] Capture decision summary
- [ ] List rationale
- [ ] Identify implications
- [ ] Note alternatives considered
- [ ] Define follow-up actions
- [ ] Set initial status

### 4. Post-Decision Tracking
- Update decision status as it progresses
- Link related decisions
- Add follow-up items to project tracking
- Periodically review and update

## Best Practices
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Use clear, objective language
- Focus on facts and reasoning
- Update decisions as they evolve
- Maintain confidentiality where required

## Decision Lifecycle
1. **Proposed** - Initial discussion stage
2. **Approved** - Council consensus reached
3. **Implemented** - Decision put into action
4. **Archived** - Decision completed or obsolete

## Tools and Templates
- Use `memory/counsel/INDEX.md` template
- Leverage git for version control
- Use markdown for easy reading and searching

## Continuous Improvement
- Quarterly review of decision-making process
- Analyze patterns in past decisions
- Refine tracking methodology

## Confidentiality and Access
- Decisions may be sensitive
- Restrict access as appropriate
- Use role-based access control
