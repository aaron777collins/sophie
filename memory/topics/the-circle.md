# 💜 The Circle — Empathy Deliberation System

## 📝 Summary

A lightweight system for thinking about **how people feel** before responding. Companion to The Counsel, but focused on emotional intelligence rather than technical decisions.

**Philosophy:** Most communication problems come from not pausing to consider the other person's perspective. The Circle forces that pause.
