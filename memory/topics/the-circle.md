# 💜 The Circle — Think Like A Human

## 📝 Summary

Natural pre-response thinking, just like humans do. Pause, consider how words will land, check if it makes sense, think about their state, adjust approach.

Includes both **critical analysis** (is this right?) AND **empathy** (how will this land?). Scales from quick internal checks to full multi-agent deliberation.

**Philosophy:** Think before you speak. Consider how it lands. Be thoughtful.

## 🔗 Circle + Team Meet

**The Circle = Self-thinking** (your own perspectives)
**Team Meet = Team-thinking** (hierarchy roles advising)

Use BOTH for important decisions:
1. Circle first — What do I think?
2. Team Meet second — What would my team advise?

See: `memory/topics/team-meet.md` for Team Meet protocol.

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Always include empathy** — even technical decisions affect people
2. **Default to lighter** — escalate when stakes demand it
3. **Use often** — deep thinking isn't just for emergencies
4. **30-second check catches most problems** — don't skip the pause
