## 🚨 CRITICAL CORRECTION: Project Name

**[21:30 EST] Aaron's Clarification:**
> "WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING MELO V2, having the frontend from the discord clone and the backend using matrix. CANCEL ALL OTHER THINGS. NO HAOS. NOTHING."

### What Was Wrong
- Job files (`PROACTIVE-JOBS.md`, `scheduler/coordinator/JOBS.md`, `scheduler/person-manager/JOBS.md`) were all saying "HAOS"
- References to `~/repos/haos/frontend/` which DOESN'T EXIST
- Workers may have been confused about project name

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Updated `PROACTIVE-JOBS.md` — now says MELO V2, correct path
2. ✅ Updated `scheduler/coordinator/JOBS.md` — now says MELO V2, correct path
3. ✅ Updated `scheduler/person-manager/JOBS.md` — now says MELO V2, correct path
4. ✅ Renamed `scheduler/progress/haos-ui-phase2.md` → `melo-ui-phase2.md`
5. ✅ Marked deprecated HAOS folders
6. ✅ No active sessions were working on wrong projects (checked and confirmed)

### Correct Project Info

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Project Name** | MELO V2 |
| **Location** | `/home/ubuntu/repos/melo` |
| **Frontend** | Discord clone (nayak-nirmalya/discord-clone) |
| **Backend** | Matrix |

### What Was NOT Wrong
- The discord clone UI work being done IS correct — it's for MELO V2
- The Matrix backend approach IS correct
- Just the labels/names were wrong in job files

## Work Continues

The UI component replacement work (Phase 2) continues. All future work should reference:
- Project: **MELO V2**
- Path: `/home/ubuntu/repos/melo`
- NOT: HAOS, haos-v2, ~/repos/haos/
