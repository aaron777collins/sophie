## Memory Sync Operations
- [12:00 AM EST] Performed memory synchronization across project progress files
- Consolidated progress for HAOS v2 project

## Project Progress Highlights
### HAOS v2 Development
- Multiple phases in progress:
  - Authentication manager
  - Channel settings
  - File upload services
  - Media upload infrastructure
  - User interface refinements
  - Development setup guides
  - GitHub Actions configuration

## [00:07 EST] HAOS v2 Final Integration Testing Complete

✅ **TASK COMPLETED:** Comprehensive final integration testing for HAOS v2 pre-release

### Results Summary
- **Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED - NOT READY FOR RELEASE
- **Application State**: Running but stuck at loading screen
- **Test Execution**: 0 of 18 tests passing due to initialization failure
- **Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suite ready but blocked by app issues

### Critical Blockers Found
1. **Application Initialization Failure** - Perpetual loading screen
2. **Missing Test Infrastructure** - No `data-cy` attributes in UI components  
3. **UI Implementation Gap** - Core Discord-like interface not implemented

### Deliverables Created
- **Complete Test Report**: `haos-v2-final-integration-test-report.md` (10KB+)
- **Technical Issues Summary**: `haos-v2-technical-issues-summary.md` (6KB+)
- **Progress Documentation**: Updated project memory with findings

### Timeline Impact
- **Estimate**: 4-5 weeks additional development needed before release readiness
- **Priority**: P0 critical issues must be resolved before any testing can proceed

### Next Actions
- Development team needs to focus on application initialization debugging
- UI implementation must include proper test attributes
- Integration testing to resume once core issues resolved
