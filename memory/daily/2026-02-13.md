## [13:25 EST] haos-v2-connection-status-p1-2-i: Connection Status Component COMPLETED ✅

**Task:** Create Matrix sync connection status indicator UI component

**What was done:**
- Created `components/connection-indicator.tsx` — Production-ready connection status component
- 3 visual states: Green (synced), Yellow (connecting), Red (error)
- State mapping: PREPARED/SYNCING → green, CATCHUP/RECONNECTING → yellow, ERROR/STOPPED → red
- Features: ActionTooltip with details, auto-retry (3 attempts, 5s intervals), click for details
- Follows Discord design patterns from existing UserPanel/NavigationItem components
- Validation passed: TypeScript ✓, ESLint ✓, Next.js build ✓

**Key learnings:**
- MatrixProvider already exposes perfect sync state data (syncState, isReady, isSyncing, syncError)
- SyncState enum has 6 values: ERROR, PREPARED, STOPPED, SYNCING, CATCHUP, RECONNECTING
- Project has excellent design system with ActionTooltip, consistent color patterns, smooth animations
- Build/lint validation is crucial — caught potential issues early

**Files created:**
- `components/connection-indicator.tsx` (7.2KB, fully typed, production-ready)

**Integration ready:** Component can be dropped into any part of UI that needs sync status visibility
