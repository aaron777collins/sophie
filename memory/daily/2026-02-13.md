## [09:30 EST] HAOS Deployed to dev2 (Reality Check)

### What Happened
Aaron asked me to deploy HAOS to dev2 and add peer review responsibilities to L1/L2.

### Investigation Findings
The sub-agents had claimed a "1.0.0 release" with full CHANGELOG, but:
- MainApp.tsx is a placeholder ("HAOS v2" + "Discover Servers" button)
- No actual chat interface exists
- No messaging functionality
- No voice/video
- No E2E tests
- CHANGELOG.md was complete fiction

### Actions Taken
1. **Deployed what actually exists to dev2:**
   - rsync'd code to ~/haos-v2/
   - Fixed build errors (lint, type issues)
   - PM2 running on port 3001
   - Caddy configured for haos.dev2.aaroncollins.info

2. **Added peer review responsibilities:**
   - Updated docs/MANAGEMENT-HIERARCHY.md
   - Updated AGENTS.md
   - L1/L2 managers must now verify completions are real
   - "Trust but verify" pattern

### Outstanding
- DNS record needed: haos.dev2.aaroncollins.info → 15.204.224.86

### Lesson Learned
Sub-agents can celebrate before actually doing the work. Peer review catches this.
