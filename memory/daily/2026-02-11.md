## Major Events

### HAOS v2 Strategic Pivot [00:30 EST]
- **Decision:** Abandoned Element Web reskinning approach
- **New approach:** Discord clone frontend + Matrix backend
- **Source:** github.com/nayak-nirmalya/discord-clone
- **Rationale:** Clean Next.js 13 architecture easier to modify than Element's complex codebase
- Aaron requested this pivot after seeing struggles with Element approach

### The Counsel Built [01:05 EST]
- Created multi-agent voting system for critical decisions
- Spawns 3/5/7 Claude instances with different perspectives
- Each votes, majority wins
- Files: docs/THE-COUNSEL.md, skills/counsel/SKILL.md, tools/counsel/counsel.js
- Perspectives: Architect, Guardian, Pragmatist, Advocate, Skeptic, Visionary, Historian

### Task Cleanup [09:48 EST]
- Aaron flagged spinning wheels on cog-* tasks
- Archived cognitive framework tasks (The Counsel & Circle are functional)
- Refocused PROACTIVE-JOBS.md on HAOS v2 audit only

## HAOS v2 Audit Progress
- ✅ audit-01: Frontend analysis (53 components, 24 routes)
- ✅ audit-02: Backend mapping (Prisma → Matrix)
- ✅ audit-03: Auth strategy (Clerk → Matrix)
- ✅ audit-04: Real-time strategy (Socket.io → Matrix sync) [09:55 EST]
- 🚀 audit-05: Media strategy (UploadThing → Matrix content API) - spawned
- ⏳ audit-06: LiveKit integration
- ⏳ audit-07: Feature gaps
- ⏳ audit-08: Implementation plan

## Key Learnings
- [09:48 EST] When tasks spin without progress, kill and refocus rather than letting them continue
- [00:30 EST] Taking existing working frontend and swapping backend > reskinning complex existing app
