# Daily Log: Wednesday, February 11th, 2026

## Key Events

### [23:00 EST] HAOS Fork Abandoned - Strategic Pivot
- **Decision:** Abandon Element Web fork, focus on haos-v2 (Discord clone + Matrix)
- **Reason:** Intractable webpack/monorepo build issues after multiple sub-agent attempts
- **Documentation:** Created `/home/ubuntu/repos/haos/DEPRECATED.md`
- **Owner:** Aaron (approved)

### [23:03 EST] Sub-Agent Memory System Analysis
- **Issue identified:** Sub-agents were repeating the same failures because:
  1. Scheduler wasn't injecting progress file context into spawn prompts
  2. Agents weren't consistently reading progress files first
  3. Daily logs weren't being updated with work
  4. Project overviews were stale
- **Fixes applied:**
  - Updated proactive-scheduler cron to inject progress context
  - Added "🩸 Blood on the Walls" section to AGENTS.md (more prominent than before)
  - Updated haos project overview with pivot decision
  - This daily log!
