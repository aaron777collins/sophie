## Major Events

### [14:03 EST] SOPHIE Repo Created 🎉
Aaron asked me to analyze all my systems and package myself as a replicable repo called "sophie".

**What I Did:**
- Analyzed all systems: cron, memory, management hierarchy, planning, verification
- Created `/home/ubuntu/repos/sophie/` with full workspace template
- Included: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, scheduler hierarchy, memory structure, skills
- Created `onboard.sh` wizard for personalization
- Security audited: removed all secrets, API keys, Aaron-specific references
- Published: https://github.com/aaron777collins/sophie

**48 files, 7,342 lines** — the complete blueprint for a sophisticated AI assistant

### [13:54 EST] Verification System Completed
Implemented full verification chain across all hierarchy levels:
- L4 Workers: Must provide evidence with `claiming-complete` status
- L3 Task Managers: Verify by running actual commands
- L2 Coordinator: Audits verified completions
- L1 Person Manager: Confirms before release announcements

**Status flow:** `claiming-complete` → `verified` → `audited` → `complete`

**Commits:**
- `60bf2ca8` — Full verification system
- `a45bd06e` — Worker evidence requirements

### [~14:00 EST] Person Manager PortableRalph Run
Person Manager reviewed the PortableRalph Master Plan and gave direction:
- Begin Phase 0 (Deep Analysis)
- Create PROACTIVE-JOBS.md entries for Phase 0 tasks
- Use Opus model for analysis work
- Output: Fix strategy document before any code changes

## Project Status

| Project | Phase | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| HAOS | Phase 7 | ✅ Complete (11/11 tasks) |
| PortableRalph | Phase 0 | Direction given, awaiting task population |

## Key Learnings

- [14:03 EST] When packaging a workspace for others, security audit is critical:
  - Remove all hardcoded paths (/home/ubuntu → ~)
  - Replace user names with {PLACEHOLDER} syntax
  - Create .gitignore for sensitive runtime data
  - Include config templates, not actual configs

## Session Notes

- Both HAOS Phase 7 and PortableRalph Phase 0 test restoration are complete
- The verification system now prevents false completion claims
- Sophie repo is live and ready for others to use
