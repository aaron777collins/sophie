## Major Events

### [14:03 EST] SOPHIE Repo Created 🎉
Aaron asked me to analyze all my systems and package myself as a replicable repo called "sophie".

**What I Did:**
- Analyzed all systems: cron, memory, management hierarchy, planning, verification
- Created `/home/ubuntu/repos/sophie/` with full workspace template
- Included: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, scheduler hierarchy, memory structure, skills
- Created `onboard.sh` wizard for personalization
- Security audited: removed all secrets, API keys, Aaron-specific references
- Published: https://github.com/aaron777collins/sophie

**48 files, 7,342 lines** — the complete blueprint for a sophisticated AI assistant

### [13:54 EST] Verification System Completed
Implemented full verification chain across all hierarchy levels:
- L4 Workers: Must provide evidence with `claiming-complete` status
- L3 Task Managers: Verify by running actual commands
- L2 Coordinator: Audits verified completions
- L1 Person Manager: Confirms before release announcements

**Status flow:** `claiming-complete` → `verified` → `audited` → `complete`

### [~14:00 EST] Person Manager PortableRalph Run
Person Manager reviewed the PortableRalph Master Plan and gave direction for Phase 0.

### [17:14 EST] Connected Driving Pipeline Thesis Summary
Aaron requested comprehensive analysis for Joshua Picchioni's thesis.

**Created:**
- Full summary of ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 architecture
- BSM (Basic Safety Message) explanation
- Wyoming CV Pilot dataset details
- Attack types (RPO, CPO) implementation
- Key findings from the published paper
- Two thesis abstract options (technical and impact-focused)

**Document:** `/tmp/thesis-abstract.md` (14KB)
**Email:** Could not send (gog OAuth not configured) - shared via Slack

### [17:17 EST] PortableRalph Test Fixes
Aaron requested finishing all incomplete tasks.

**Issues Found:**
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md claimed 10/10 tests passing, but actual: 6/10
- Remote repo (origin/master) also claims 10/10 but unverified

**Fixes Made:**
1. test-constants-lib.sh — Fixed RALPH_DIR calculation
2. test-integration.sh — Fixed exit code expectation (bash -n returns 2)
3. test-security.sh — Fixed grep patterns (false positives on eval/sudo)
4. test-security-fixes.sh — Fixed to use --test flag
5. Created start-monitor.sh (bash version)
6. Made notify.sh failures non-fatal
7. Added set -euo pipefail to configure.sh, launcher.sh

**Challenge:** Local changes conflict with remote. Test suite runs slow due to timeout tests.

## Project Status

| Project | Phase | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| HAOS | Phase 7 | ✅ Complete (11/11 tasks) |
| PortableRalph | Phase 0 | ⚠️ Tests need reconciliation |

## Key Learnings

- [14:03 EST] When packaging a workspace for others, security audit is critical
- [17:30 EST] Test suites with timeout tests can take very long to run
- [17:30 EST] Always verify "complete" claims by actually running tests

## Session Notes

- SOPHIE repo is live and ready for others to use
- Connected Driving thesis materials prepared for Joshua
- PortableRalph needs final reconciliation between local and remote
