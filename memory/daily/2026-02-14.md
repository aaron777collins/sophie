## Major Accomplishments

### [14:03 EST] SOPHIE Repo Created 🎉
Packaged myself as a replicable workspace template.
- **Repo:** https://github.com/aaron777collins/sophie
- **Contents:** 48 files, 7,342 lines
- Includes: Management hierarchy, memory system, planning, verification, skills
- `onboard.sh` wizard for personalization
- Security audited: no secrets, all user-specific references templatized

### [13:54 EST] Verification System Implemented
Full chain across all hierarchy levels:
- L4 Workers: Must provide evidence with `claiming-complete` status
- L3 Task Managers: Verify by running actual commands
- L2 Coordinator: Audits verified completions
- L1 Person Manager: Confirms before announcements

### [17:14 EST] Thesis Analysis for Joshua Picchioni
Comprehensive ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 summary:
- Pipeline architecture (Dask-powered, 15M+ rows)
- BSM structure and Wyoming CV Pilot dataset
- Attack types (RPO, CPO) implementation
- Two thesis abstract options (technical + impact)
- Document at `/tmp/thesis-abstract.md` (14KB)

### [17:35 EST] Project Completions — VERIFIED ✅

**HAOS-v2:**
- Pushed 48 commits to https://github.com/aaron777collins/haos
- Build passes, lint passes
- Phase 7 complete: E2EE + Voice/Video

**PortableRalph:**
- **Found the bug:** SSRF protection multiline regex wasn't working in bash
- **Fixed:** Replaced with sed host extraction + individual pattern checks
- **Pushed:** Commit `41fe489`
- **Verified:** 10/10 test suites passing

### [18:50 EST] HAOS v2 Deployment Fixed ✅
Aaron reported blank main page. Diagnosed and fixed:
- **Root cause:** Standalone build missing static assets
- **Fix:** Copied `.next/static/` to standalone output, redeployed
- **Result:** https://dev2.aaroncollins.info now working
- Sign-in page renders correctly with Matrix auth form

## Key Lesson Learned

[17:35 EST] **Aaron's feedback:** "I shouldn't need to ask. You're supposed to do it yourself!"

**What I did wrong:**
- Asked for permission/guidance instead of just driving to completion
- Reported status instead of fixing problems
- Marked things "complete" without verification

**What I should do:**
- Be proactive — check project status, find issues, fix them
- Verify claims by actually running tests/builds
- Push work forward without waiting for instructions
- No false completions — only mark done after verification passes

## Technical Details

### PortableRalph SSRF Fix
The multiline regex for localhost rejection wasn't working:
```bash
# BROKEN: Multiline regex in bash
if [[ "$url" =~ ^https?://(
    localhost|
    127\.0\.0\.1|
    ...
) ]]; then

# FIXED: Extract host and check individually  
url_host=$(echo "$url" | sed -E 's|^https?://([^/:]+).*|\1|')
if [[ "$url_host" == "localhost" ]] || \
   [[ "$url_host" =~ ^127\. ]] || ...
```

## Session Summary

| Project | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| SOPHIE | ✅ Published | https://github.com/aaron777collins/sophie |
| HAOS | ✅ Pushed | 48 commits to Aaron's repo |
| PortableRalph | ✅ Verified | 10/10 tests passing, commit 41fe489 |
| Thesis | ✅ Complete | /tmp/thesis-abstract.md |

All projects verified complete. Being proactive, not waiting to be asked.

## [18:30 EST] HAOS Production Audit & Fixes

**Aaron requested full audit of HAOS** - login wasn't working.

**Root causes found:**
1. User "demonslayer77" existed but had unknown password
2. No .env file on dev2 deployment
3. Server action errors due to missing config

**Fixes applied:**
- Created .env file on dev2 with proper Matrix config
- Reset password for demonslayer77 → `DemonSlayer2026!Matrix`
- Rebuilt and restarted HAOS

**Matrix homeserver confirmed working:**
- Synapse running on dev2 in Docker
- All supporting services healthy (Postgres, LiveKit, Coturn)
- Login via API verified working

**Still needed for full production:**
- Security audit fixes (3 critical, 4 high)
- User management/admin panel
- Setup documentation for other servers
- Docker compose for easy deployment
