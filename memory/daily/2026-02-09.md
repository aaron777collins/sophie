# 2026-02-09 — Matrix Server Deployment

## Session Times
- **~13:56 EST** - Matrix setup on dev2

## Matrix Server Setup (~13:56-14:05 EST)

Aaron requested setup of Matrix ecosystem on dev2.aaroncollins.info based on prior research discussion.

### What Was Deployed
- **Synapse** (Matrix homeserver) with PostgreSQL backend
- **Element Web** (client interface)
- **Coturn** (TURN server for video/voice calls)
- **Caddy** integration for SSL and routing

### Key Decisions
- Used existing Caddy reverse proxy instead of adding nginx
- Connected Caddy to Matrix Docker network for container DNS
- PostgreSQL 16 for production database
- TURN server on host network for NAT traversal

### Outcome
✅ All services healthy and accessible at https://dev2.aaroncollins.info
