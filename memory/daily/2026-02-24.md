## Pipeline Critical Fix - [08:15 EST]

### Issue Identified
Aaron reported that pipeline.log files contained "No log files found" instead of actual verbose logs.

**Root Cause:** Logger class uses dependency injection via StandardDependencyInjection. First pipeline's PathProvider gets cached and reused by ALL subsequent pipelines. This caused all log files to be written to `logs/basic_100km_const/` regardless of which pipeline was running.

**Evidence:**
- `logs/basic_100km_const/` contained: `basic_100km_rand.txt`, `basic_200km_const.txt`, etc.
- Other pipeline directories like `logs/basic_100km_rand/` never existed
- `consolidate_logs()` looked for `logs/{pipeline_name}/` which didn't exist for most pipelines

### Fix Applied - [08:20 EST]
Modified `run_all_pipelines.py` to capture stdout/stderr directly using TeeWriter class:
- Bypasses broken Logger dependency injection
- Captures verbose output including row counts, vehicle IDs, ML metrics
- Runs with PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 for real-time logging

### Actions Taken
1. Backed up original: `run_all_pipelines.py.backup`
2. Deployed fix via SCP
3. Cleared all artifacts:
   - `/var/www/static/pipeline-results/*`
   - `data/classifierdata/splitfiles/combinedcleaned/*`
   - `data/mclassifierdata/*`
   - `Outputs/*`
   - `logs/*`
4. Started fresh 36-pipeline run

### Pipeline Progress (basic_100km_const)
- Total rows: 3,435,803
- Vehicle IDs: 1,662 total
- Train: 2,748,642 rows, 1,336 vehicles, 401 attackers
- Test: 687,161 rows, 353 vehicles, 106 attackers
