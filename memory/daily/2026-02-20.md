## [21:23 EST] melo-v2-server-settings-modal-p2-4-b: COMPLETED ✅

Successfully implemented comprehensive server settings modal for MELO v2 Discord clone:

### Major Achievement
- **29.8KB production-ready modal component** with full Matrix integration
- **5 functional tabs**: Overview, Roles, Members, Invites, Danger Zone  
- **Zero TypeScript errors**, ESLint clean, follows project patterns

### Technical Implementation
- **Radix UI tabs**: Created reusable tabs component (`components/ui/tabs.tsx`)
- **Matrix services integration**: Used matrix-space, matrix-member, matrix-invite services
- **Form validation**: react-hook-form + zod schemas for all forms
- **Real-time updates**: Matrix SDK event listeners for live data
- **Permission system**: Matrix power levels mapped to Discord-style roles

### Key Features Delivered  
1. **Overview**: Server name/avatar/description editing with FileUpload
2. **Roles**: Visual hierarchy display (Owner→Admin→Moderator→Member→Restricted)  
3. **Members**: Complete member management (kick/ban/role changes)
4. **Invites**: Full invite lifecycle (create/revoke/copy/usage tracking)
5. **Danger Zone**: Multi-step deletion (name + password + DELETE confirmation)

### Integration Work
- Added "serverSettings" modal type to store
- Updated modal provider to register component  
- Added "Server Settings" option to server header dropdown (admin only)
