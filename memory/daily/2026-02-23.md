### [16:00 EST] Aaron - Pipeline & Melo V2 Issues

**ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 Status:**
- All 18 jobs completed (as of today)
- **PROBLEM:** Output CSV files are empty - just repeating headers with no actual data
- Only `DaskMClassifierConstOffsetPerID100To200.csv` (477KB, from Feb 20) has real results
- Recent runs (Feb 23) completed but didn't produce actual results
- Need to investigate pipeline output stage / run logs

**Melo V2 Issues Identified:**
1. **No Admin Navigation** - Admin pages exist (`/admin/invites`, `/admin/jobs`) but NO clickable links from main UI
2. **Captcha Error** - From matrix.org registration requirements, not Melo (Melo doesn't implement reCAPTCHA)
3. **Rate Limiting** - "5 requests in 900 seconds" is matrix.org's restrictive limit
4. **Login Screen Width** - UI issue on desktop, needs proper breakpoints
5. **demonslayer77 Issues** - Old Element usage may conflict with Melo's expectations
6. **Invite-Only vs Matrix.org** - `privateMode` is default but toggle switches to matrix.org which bypasses invites

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Investigate pipeline empty output issue
- [ ] Add admin navigation to Melo V2 main UI
- [ ] Fix desktop auth page styling
- [ ] Improve error messages for matrix.org captcha/rate limit scenarios

## Reflection

Quiet day after major User Story & Validation System implementation (Feb 22). Good consolidation period. Key insight: not every day needs high output - sustainable rhythm matters.
