## [15:05 EST] p2-2-a: Completed Channel Sidebar Implementation

**Task:** Implement Discord-style channel sidebar with collapsible categories and member toggle

**What was accomplished:**
- ✅ Added collapsible functionality to channel categories with chevron rotation animation
- ✅ Implemented member list toggle with eye/eye-off icons
- ✅ Maintained existing server name header with dropdown functionality
- ✅ Preserved channel list with proper type icons (hash, mic, video)
- ✅ Created proper server/client component separation
- ✅ All TypeScript validation passed

**Technical approach:**
- Modified `components/server/server-section.tsx` to add collapsible state and chevron animation
- Created new `components/server/server-sidebar-content.tsx` client component for interactive features
- Refactored `components/server/server-sidebar.tsx` to maintain server-side data fetching while using client component
- Used proper Prisma types to avoid TypeScript errors

**Files modified:**
- `components/server/server-section.tsx` — added collapsible functionality
- `components/server/server-sidebar-content.tsx` — NEW client component
- `components/server/server-sidebar.tsx` — refactored architecture

**Validation completed:**
- Build successful (TypeScript compilation passed)
- ESLint validation passed  
- All imports resolve correctly
- Maintains Discord design patterns
- Git commit: 62b339a
