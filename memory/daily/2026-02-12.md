- **Found:** Task was completed by previous agent but cleanup steps were missed
- **Issue:** Heartbeat file still existed, no completion notification sent
- **Actions:** 
  - Verified hook implementation exists at `/home/ubuntu/repos/haos-v2/hooks/use-room-messages.ts` (498 lines, production-ready)
  - Removed stale heartbeat file: `~/clawd/scheduler/heartbeats/haos-v2-use-room-messages-p1-2-e.json`
  - Sent Slack completion notification to channel C0ABAU26S6N
  - Updated task progress file with cleanup notes
- **Result:** Task now properly marked complete in all systems
- **Learning:** Previous agents must follow ALL completion steps in AGENTS.md, including heartbeat cleanup and notifications
