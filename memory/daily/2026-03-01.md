### [11:10 EST] MAJOR SYSTEM UPDATE: VSDD + Team Meet + Adversarial Validator

Aaron directed comprehensive methodology updates based on VSDD (Verified Spec-Driven Development) analysis:

**New Documents Created:**
- `docs/VSDD-METHODOLOGY.md` — Full VSDD methodology (purity boundaries, contract chain, Red Gate)
- `memory/topics/team-meet.md` — Team Meet thinking pattern (hierarchy roles advising)
- `scheduler/validator/ADVERSARIAL-PERSONA.md` — Harsh validator persona

**Updated Agent Identities (ALL):**
- Person Manager — Circle + Team Meet, VSDD epic requirements
- Story Architect — Circle + Team Meet, VSDD story requirements
- Coordinator — Circle + Team Meet, VSDD task requirements
- Task Managers — Circle + Team Meet, VSDD worker assignments
- Workers — Circle + Team Meet, VSDD implementation patterns
- Validator — ADVERSARIAL PERSONA (harsh, zero tolerance, fresh context)

**Updated Core Files:**
- `AGENTS.md` — Added Thinking Patterns section, VSDD section, Adversarial Validator section
- `IDENTITY.md` (Sophie) — Added Circle + Team Meet thinking patterns
- `memory/topics/the-circle.md` — Added reference to Team Meet
- `memory/INDEX.md` — Added new critical topics

**Key Changes:**
1. **Circle + Team Meet for all agents** — Self-thinking + Team-thinking required
2. **Purity Boundaries (DDD)** — Pure core / effectful shell architecture mandatory
3. **Full Contract Chain** — Spec → Property → Bead → Test → Code → Review
4. **The Red Gate** — ALL tests must fail before implementation starts
5. **Adversarial Validator** — Harsh, zero tolerance, "Prove me wrong" stance
6. **Modular = Testable = Debuggable** — All code maps to specs

**Aaron's Directives:**
- Claude only (no Gemini/other models)
- Harsh validator persona
- DDD-style architecture for debuggability
- All agents use Circle + Team Meet
- Update all specs and fix all projects

## Learnings

### [11:10 EST] VSDD Integration
- Purity boundaries help isolate testable logic from side effects
- Team Meet provides structured way to get "team advice" when making decisions
- Adversarial validation catches issues that friendly validation misses
- Contract chain traceability makes debugging much easier
