## 2024 Tax Donation Summary Task [10:29-10:40 EST]

### Request
Aaron requested a summary of 2024 tax receipts for donations with:
- Correct numbers computed via Python
- All documents attached
- Paperless grouping for donation docs

### Actions Taken

1. **Searched Paperless** for all 2024 donation-related documents
2. **Found 3 official receipts:**
   - Parkwood Gospel Church: $8,183.44 (Doc ID 8398)
   - Crossroads Christian Communications: $103.00 (Doc ID 25913)
   - PayPal Giving Fund: $1.00 (email receipt)

3. **Python Verification:**
   ```python
   total = 8183.44 + 103.00 + 1.00  # = $8,287.44 ✓
   ```

4. **Downloaded PDFs** from Paperless API:
   - Parkwood receipt (83KB)
   - Crossroads receipt (109KB)

5. **Tagged documents** in Paperless with "Taxes 2024" (Tag ID 10)

6. **Created summary document** at `~/clawd/data/tax-receipts-2024/`

7. **Sent to Slack:**
   - Summary message with table
   - Parkwood PDF attachment
   - Crossroads PDF attachment
   - Summary markdown file

### Important Note
Parkwood official receipt shows $8,183.44 which is higher than the $6,245.15 from my earlier individual donation breakdown. The difference ($1,938.29) may be from pre-authorized giving not tracked individually. Official receipt is authoritative.

### Files Created

## Fancy Email Summary Sent [10:41-10:50 EST]

### Request
Aaron requested a fancy HTML email summary with all docs attached.

### Actions Taken
1. Created professional HTML email template with:
   - Styled header with gradient background
   - Donation cards with amounts and charity info
   - Summary table
   - Python verification code block
   - Footer with links

2. Attached both PDF receipts:

The IMAP "save to Sent folder" step timed out but the email itself was delivered via SMTP successfully. This is a himalaya/IMAP issue with the fastmail sent folder, not with delivery.
