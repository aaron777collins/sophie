## 2024 Tax Donation Summary Task [10:29-10:40 EST]

### Request
Aaron requested a summary of 2024 tax receipts for donations with:
- Correct numbers computed via Python
- All documents attached
- Paperless grouping for donation docs

### Actions Taken

1. **Searched Paperless** for all 2024 donation-related documents
2. **Found 3 official receipts:**
   - Parkwood Gospel Church: $8,183.44 (Doc ID 8398)
   - Crossroads Christian Communications: $103.00 (Doc ID 25913)
   - PayPal Giving Fund: $1.00 (email receipt)

3. **Python Verification:**
   ```python
   total = 8183.44 + 103.00 + 1.00  # = $8,287.44 ✓
   ```

4. **Downloaded PDFs** from Paperless API:
   - Parkwood receipt (83KB)
   - Crossroads receipt (109KB)

5. **Tagged documents** in Paperless with "Taxes 2024" (Tag ID 10)

6. **Created summary document** at `~/clawd/data/tax-receipts-2024/`

7. **Sent to Slack:**
   - Summary message with table
   - Parkwood PDF attachment
   - Crossroads PDF attachment
   - Summary markdown file

### Important Note
Parkwood official receipt shows $8,183.44 which is higher than the $6,245.15 from my earlier individual donation breakdown. The difference ($1,938.29) may be from pre-authorized giving not tracked individually. Official receipt is authoritative.

### Files Created
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/data/tax-receipts-2024/2024_DONATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/data/tax-receipts-2024/Parkwood_Gospel_Church_2024_Tax_Receipt.pdf`
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/data/tax-receipts-2024/Crossroads_2024_Tax_Receipt.pdf`


## Fancy Email Summary Sent [10:41-10:50 EST]

### Request
Aaron requested a fancy HTML email summary with all docs attached.

### Actions Taken
1. Created professional HTML email template with:
   - Styled header with gradient background
   - Donation cards with amounts and charity info
   - Summary table
   - Python verification code block
   - Footer with links

2. Attached both PDF receipts:
   - Parkwood_Gospel_Church_2024_Tax_Receipt.pdf
   - Crossroads_2024_Tax_Receipt.pdf

3. Sent via himalaya to aaron777collins@gmail.com
   - Email sent via SMTP ✅
   - Cc'd to contact@aaroncollins.info

### Technical Note
The IMAP "save to Sent folder" step timed out but the email itself was delivered via SMTP successfully. This is a himalaya/IMAP issue with the fastmail sent folder, not with delivery.


## Final Donation Summary Sent [11:05-11:10 EST]

### Aaron's Request
- Prepare final donation summary with ALL receipts as proof
- If no proof, exclude from total
- Find PayPal receipt if possible

### PayPal Search Results
Searched for PayPal Giving Fund ($1.00) receipt:
- ❌ Paperless: Not found (searched by charity BN, transaction ID, "cancer", "giving fund")
- ❌ Fastmail: Not found (searched INBOX, Archive, High Priority/Taxes, Sent)
- Gmail: Not configured in himalaya - likely location of receipt

**Decision:** Excluded PayPal from total due to no available proof

### Final Summary Sent
- **Email sent:** aaron777collins@gmail.com (Bcc: contact@aaroncollins.info)
- **Total claimed:** $8,286.44
- **Attachments:**
  1. Parkwood_Gospel_Church_2024_Tax_Receipt.pdf ($8,183.44)
  2. Crossroads_2024_Tax_Receipt.pdf ($103.00)

### Files
- Summary: `~/clawd/data/tax-receipts-2024/2024_DONATION_SUMMARY_FINAL.md`
- PDFs: Both in same directory


## [11:35 EST] Testing Methodology Fix — Aaron Directive

**Aaron's Directive:** Audit proactive jobs system and fix the unit/E2E gap

**Problem Identified:**
- Workers were running unit tests only (100% pass)
- E2E tests were failing massively (92% fail rate)
- Features appeared complete based on unit tests but were completely broken in UI

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated AGENTS.md, Worker/Coordinator/Validator IDENTITY.md
- Mandated E2E tests at ALL validation layers
- New rule: Unit test success + E2E failure = NOT COMPLETE
- Workers must run `pnpm test:e2e` before claiming needs-validation
- Commit: f965fde

## [18:22 EST] dyndev System Created

Built path-based routing system for quick dev app deployment.

**URL:** `https://dyndev3.aaroncollins.info`
**Location:** `/home/ubuntu/dyndev/`

### Usage
```bash
dyndev add myapp 3000   # Route /myapp/* → localhost:3000
dyndev list             # Show routes
dyndev status           # Health checks
dyndev remove myapp     # Remove route
```

### Key Points
- Path prefix stripped automatically (apps don't need to know about /myapp/)
- Single Let's Encrypt cert (HTTP challenge, no DNS API needed)
- Hot reload on changes
- WebSocket compatible

### Aaron's Instruction
**When deploying new apps, ASK whether he wants:**
1. Custom subdomain (e.g., `myapp.aaroncollins.info`) — needs DNS entry
2. dyndev path (e.g., `dyndev3.aaroncollins.info/myapp/`) — instant
