## Memory Sync Processing
- [2026-02-17 06:00 EST] Ran memory synchronization across project progress files

## System Notes
- Multiple project progress files detected and processed
## [11:00 EST] MELO v2 Build Fixed - Person Manager

### Accomplishment
Fixed the production build that was hanging indefinitely. Build now completes in ~60 seconds.

### Root Causes Fixed
1. **Tailwind CSS v4** was installed - required downgrade to v3.4.17
2. **Edge runtime incompatibility** - middleware used Node.js-only logging
3. **Matrix SDK exports** - missing exports and deep import conflicts

### Changes Committed
- `fd7aec0` - fix: production build - Tailwind v3, edge-compatible middleware, Matrix SDK exports

### Status
- ✅ Build passes (44 pages)
- ✅ Dev server works
- ⚠️ Still missing: DMs, Server Discovery, 2FA
- 📄 Full report: `memory/projects/MELO/STATUS-REPORT-2026-02-17.md`
