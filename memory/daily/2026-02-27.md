### [01:37 EST] Major Directive from Aaron

Aaron gave comprehensive directives before bed:

**Immediate Tasks:**
1. Check OVH emails - find what VPS dev2 is, learn about price increase
2. Investigate Ralph CI/CD failure
3. Mark Returnzie failures (lowest priority)
4. Audit Melo V2 on dev2 - find missing features from Discord, fix broken parts

**System Requirements:**
1. Build smart reflection & proactive work system:
   - Daily reflect on active projects + day's work
   - Generate thoughtful surprise tools/features/actions
   - Use feature flags for safe rollout
   - Run everything by Circle counsel
   - Track Aaron's schedule and learn about him
   - Give summaries (completion + morning)
   - Use proper Opus planning, epics/stories, Playwright validation

**Key Principles:**
- One thing at a time, investigated properly
- All work tested with screenshots as proof
- Run surprises by counsel
- Nothing broken - validated before presenting
- Note: Paperless now indexes emails for content search

### [01:45 EST] Built Surprise & Reflection System

Created comprehensive system per Aaron's directive:
- `docs/SURPRISE-AND-REFLECTION-SYSTEM.md` - Full design
- `scheduler/surprises/` - Pipeline directories
- `scheduler/feature-flags/flags.yaml` - Feature flag system
- `memory/summaries/` - Morning and completion summaries
- Enhanced `memory/people/aaron.md` with schedule tracking
- Created `morning-summary` cron (09:00 EST daily)
- Enhanced `daily-reflection` cron with surprise generation

## Decisions Made
- [01:45 EST] Decision: Build system infrastructure FIRST before tackling individual tasks (per Aaron's explicit instruction)

## Learnings
- [01:37 EST] Aaron goes to bed around 01:30-02:00 EST
- [01:37 EST] Paperless-ngx now imports all emails - can search content there too

## Follow-ups
- [ ] Check OVH email for dev2 VPS price increase
- [ ] Investigate Ralph CI/CD failure
- [ ] Mark Returnzie CI failures for investigation
- [ ] Audit Melo V2 on dev2 for missing features
