## Structure

| Folder | Purpose | Scaling Pattern |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `daily/` | Conversation logs | Always files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) |
| `projects/` | Project context | File → Folder when large |
| `topics/` | Domain knowledge | File → Folder when large |
| `people/` | People context | Usually files |
| `reflections/` | Self-improvement logs | Organized by type |

**Scaling Rule:** When file > 500 lines or has 3+ sub-areas:
- Convert to folder with same name
- Create `_overview.md` as index
- Split content into sub-files
