# Cognitive Framework Project

Operationalizing Sophie's thinking and learning systems: The Circle, The Counsel, and Self-Reflection.

## Status: Active 🟢

**Started:** 2026-02-11
**Source:** Counsel session evaluating the framework architecture

## Components

### The Circle
Multi-perspective thinking framework with weight-based scaling (Internal → Council).
- **Status:** Documented, needs skill file + CLI tooling
- **Docs:** `docs/THE-CIRCLE.md`

### The Counsel
Maximum-weight Circle invocation (5-7 Opus counselors) for mission-critical decisions.
- **Status:** Documented, implemented, needs quorum rules + dissent protocol
- **Docs:** `docs/THE-COUNSEL.md`

### Self-Reflection
Daily learning loop: log → reflect → improve.
- **Status:** Documented, nightly cron set up, needs tooling for low-friction logging
- **Docs:** `docs/SELF-REFLECTION.md`

## Current Phase: Operationalization

The Counsel identified these gaps on 2026-02-11:
1. No skill file for programmatic Circle invocation
2. Friction in daily logging (needs `reflect` CLI)
3. Missing escalation triggers and quorum rules
4. No improvement validation tracking
5. No decision index for pattern recognition

## Task Queue

See `PROACTIVE-JOBS.md` → Cognitive Framework Tasks section (cog-01 through cog-09).

## Timeline

- [2026-02-11 01:30 EST] Counsel session initiated to evaluate framework
- [2026-02-11 01:42 EST] Perspectives received: Architect, Skeptic, Builder
- [2026-02-11 01:45 EST] 9 proactive tasks queued for implementation
- [2026-02-11] Aaron: "Fix it all, make it fully operational"

## Key Insights from Counsel

**Architect:** Architecture is sound, needs operationalization — explicit escalation triggers, quorum rules, decision index.

**Skeptic:** Validation gaps — how do we know improvements worked? Human feedback should override self-assessment. Need regression detection.

**Builder:** "A system that's used imperfectly beats a perfect system too cumbersome to invoke." Needs `reflect` and `circle` CLIs to reduce friction.
