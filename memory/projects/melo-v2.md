## ⚠️ CRITICAL TRUTHS (DO NOT FORGET)

### LiveKit - ALREADY CONFIGURED ON DEV2
**[2026-02-23] Aaron has stated MULTIPLE TIMES:**
- dev2.aaroncollins.info HAS LiveKit running
- It is NOT a blocker
- Melo just needs to USE the existing LiveKit on dev2
- STOP treating this as missing infrastructure

### Validation Screenshots - MANDATORY
**[2026-02-23] Non-negotiable requirement:**
- NO validation passes without Playwright screenshots
- ALL acceptance criteria need visual evidence
- ALL 3 sizes: Desktop (1920x1080), Tablet (768x1024), Mobile (375x667)
- Screenshots stored in: scheduler/validation/screenshots/{project}/{story-id}/
- This is a HARD GATE, not a suggestion
