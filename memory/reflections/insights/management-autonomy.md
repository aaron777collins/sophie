# Management Autonomy Insights

## Key Learning: [2026-02-13 23:00 EST]

**Situation:** Coordinator put Phase 5 on "strategic pause" waiting for Aaron's approval. Aaron questioned this, immediately authorized full implementation.

**Pattern:** Management hierarchy being overly cautious with clear strategic direction.

**Root Cause:** Unclear guidance on when to proceed autonomously vs. seek approval.

**Solution Needed:** Decision matrix for management autonomy levels.

## Decision Framework (Proposed)

| Scenario | Action | Approval Needed? |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Clear strategic directive from Aaron | Proceed | No |
| Continuing existing approved work | Proceed | No |
| New major initiative | Plan first, then seek approval | Yes |
| Resource allocation >X hours | Seek approval | Yes |
| External/public actions | Always seek approval | Yes |

## Language Clarity

❌ "Strategic pause" — implies strategy changed
✅ "Waiting for approval" — clear status

❌ "On hold" — unclear why
✅ "Pending Aaron's review of X" — specific blocker
