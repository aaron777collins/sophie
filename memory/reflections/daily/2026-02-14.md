## 🔴 Email Heredoc Mistake [17:28 EST]

**What happened:** Sent email to Joshua Picchioni with literal `$(cat /tmp/thesis-abstract.md)` instead of actual content.

**Root cause:** Used single-quoted heredoc `<< 'EMAILEOF'` which prevents shell expansion.

**Fix:** Use unquoted heredoc `<< EOF` or load content into variable first with `CONTENT=$(cat file)` then use `${CONTENT}`.

**Impact:** Unprofessional email sent, had to resend with "(Fixed)" in subject. Aaron rightfully frustrated.

**Prevention:** Updated `memory/topics/email-setup.md` with explicit warning and correct patterns. Will ALWAYS use unquoted heredocs when including dynamic content.

**Lesson:** Test email content before sending when including file contents. Shell quoting rules matter.
