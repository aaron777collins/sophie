## 🔴 Email Heredoc Mistake [17:28 EST]

**What happened:** Sent email to Joshua Picchioni with literal `$(cat /tmp/thesis-abstract.md)` instead of actual content.

**Root cause:** Used single-quoted heredoc `<< 'EMAILEOF'` which prevents shell expansion.

**Fix:** Use unquoted heredoc `<< EOF` or load content into variable first with `CONTENT=$(cat file)` then use `${CONTENT}`.

**Impact:** Unprofessional email sent, had to resend with "(Fixed)" in subject. Aaron rightfully frustrated.

**Prevention:** Updated `memory/topics/email-setup.md` with explicit warning and correct patterns. Will ALWAYS use unquoted heredocs when including dynamic content.

**Lesson:** Test email content before sending when including file contents. Shell quoting rules matter.

## 🔴 Markdown in Email Mistake [17:32 EST]

**What happened:** Sent email with raw markdown formatting (`**bold**`, `# headers`, etc.) which doesn't render in plain text email.

**Fix:** Convert markdown to plain text using sed:
- Headers → UPPERCASE with underlines
- Remove `**` and backticks
- Convert `-` bullets to `•`

**Prevention:** Updated `memory/topics/email-setup.md` with conversion script.

**Lesson:** Always convert markdown documents to plain text before emailing. Emails are NOT rendered markdown.

## 🟢 HTML Emails Success [17:37 EST]

**What happened:** Aaron wanted fancy formatted emails, not plain text.

**Solution:** Use himalaya's MML format with `<#multipart type=alternative>` to send HTML emails with plain text fallback.

**Key syntax:**
```
<#multipart type=alternative>
Plain text fallback
<#part type=text/html>
${HTML_CONTENT}
<#/multipart>
```

**Result:** Beautiful styled email with tables, color-coded insights, proper typography.

**Documented:** Updated `memory/topics/email-setup.md` with full HTML email guide.
