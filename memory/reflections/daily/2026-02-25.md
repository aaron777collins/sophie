# Daily Reflection - 2026-02-25

## Key Activities Today
- **[09:46 EST]** Generated comprehensive Wyoming Connected Driving Pipeline status report
- Technical project monitoring and documentation
- ML pipeline progress tracking (54/108 completed, 50% progress)

## Notable Moments

### 🟢 **Did Well**
- **[09:46 EST]** Created highly detailed technical status report with:
  - Clear progress metrics (54/108 pipelines, 50% complete)
  - Comprehensive data tables (timing, accuracy, performance)
  - Proactive problem identification and solutions
  - Live monitoring commands and dashboard links
  - Structured formatting for easy scanning

### 🔴 **Could Improve**
- **[09:46 EST]** Status report was entirely manual - could explore automation
- May benefit from standardized technical report templates
- Could investigate better tooling for pipeline monitoring automation

### 🤔 **Interesting**
- **[09:46 EST]** Aaron's ML project achieving 99%+ accuracy on vehicle attack detection
- Complex technical project with 108 total pipelines across different radii and feature sets
- Sophisticated problem-solving around memory deadlocks with large datasets
