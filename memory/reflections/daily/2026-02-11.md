# 🪞 Reflection Notes: 2026-02-11

## 🟢 Did Well

- [01:05 EST] Created The Counsel system — multi-agent deliberation for critical decisions
- [01:12 EST] Removed artificial rate limits when Aaron said deep thinking is encouraged
- [01:12 EST] Beautified all Counsel docs with emojis, templates, visual formatting
- [01:15 EST] Added Counsel to AGENTS.md and IDENTITY.md so new instances know about it
- [01:15 EST] Added custom perspectives feature for domain-specific decisions
- [01:17 EST] Created The Circle — empathy-focused deliberation companion
- [01:21 EST] Unified Circle + Counsel — same system, different weights (great insight from Aaron)
- [01:29 EST] Reframed as "Think Like A Human" — natural pre-response thinking, not ceremony
- [01:33 EST] Created Self-Reflection system — daily learning and continuous improvement
- [01:36 EST] Set up cron for nightly reflection (23:00 EST)

## 🤔 Interesting

- [01:21 EST] Key insight: The Circle shouldn't be two separate systems — Counsel is just Circle at max weight. Both include critical thinking AND empathy.
- [01:29 EST] Key insight: This isn't about formal deliberation — it's about thinking like humans do. Pause, consider how words land, check if it makes sense, think about their state.
- [01:33 EST] Aaron's vision: Continuous improvement through reflection, just like humans learn from experience. Log throughout day, deep analysis at night, actually implement changes.

## 💬 Feedback Received

- [01:10 EST] Aaron: Confirmed we're using direct Anthropic API, not OpenRouter
- [01:11 EST] Aaron: "I actually encourage deep thinking" — removed rate limits
- [01:12 EST] Aaron: "Make it colorful and beautiful" — beautified docs
- [01:17 EST] Aaron: Circle should have critical thinking too, not just empathy
- [01:21 EST] Aaron: "Think about how humans think and respond" — key reframe
- [01:33 EST] Aaron: Daily reflection system that actually improves things

## 🔄 First Self-Reflection (via Counsel)

Ran 🟠 Elevated Circle analysis on tonight's work. Counselors: Architect, Skeptic (others timed out).

### 🏛️ Architect's Insights
- ✅ Architecture is sound — weight-based scaling is elegant
- ⚠️ Gap: No decision history index → **FIXED: Created `memory/counsel/INDEX.md`**
- ⚠️ Gap: Missing formal escalation triggers → **FIXED: Added to THE-CIRCLE.md**
- ⚠️ Gap: No quorum/failure handling → **FIXED: Added to THE-CIRCLE.md**
- 💡 Future: Add metrics/observability layer

### 🔍 Skeptic's Insights
- ✅ Self-reflection loop is most valuable piece
- ⚠️ Gap: No validation improvements work → **FIXED: Added to SELF-REFLECTION.md**
- ⚠️ Gap: Human feedback should override self → **FIXED: Added hierarchy**
- ⚠️ Gap: Counsel dissent should be flagged → **FIXED: Added dissent protocol**
- 💡 Future: Regression detection, lesson durability tracking

### Changes Made
1. `memory/counsel/INDEX.md` — Decision history tracking
2. `docs/THE-CIRCLE.md` — Added escalation triggers, quorum rules, dissent protocol, human feedback hierarchy
3. `docs/SELF-REFLECTION.md` — Added improvement validation, human feedback priority

## 📋 What We Built Tonight

### 💜 The Circle (Deep Thinking System)
- **Docs:** `docs/THE-CIRCLE.md`, `docs/THE-COUNSEL.md`
- **Skill:** `skills/circle/SKILL.md`
- **Memory:** `memory/topics/the-circle.md`, `memory/topics/the-counsel.md`
- **Weight levels:** Internal → Light → Standard → Elevated → Council
- **Two halves:** Critical thinking + Empathy
- **Custom perspectives:** Data Scientist, Economist, Designer, etc.

### 🪞 Self-Reflection System
- **Docs:** `docs/SELF-REFLECTION.md`
- **Memory:** `memory/reflections/` (daily/, insights/, improvements/)
- **Cron:** `daily-reflection` at 23:00 EST (Sonnet, high thinking)
- **Flow:** Log throughout day → Nightly analysis → Actually improve

### 📝 Updated Core Files
- `AGENTS.md` — Added Circle section, Self-Reflection section
- `IDENTITY.md` — Added Circle as key capability, Self-Reflection section
- [02:16] 🟢 **Did Well:** Test entry - reflect CLI is working
- [02:16] 🔴 **Could Improve:** Should test all features
- [02:16] 🤔 **Interesting:** Symlink resolution was tricky
- [02:16] 💬 **Feedback:** Made it zero-friction

## 🔴 Could Improve

- [14:30 EST] **Fabricated URL:** Referenced a dashboard URL (`jaekel.mcmastergdsc.ca/dashboard/`) for ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 that doesn't exist. The pipeline results are local to the Jaekel server (SSH access only), not publicly accessible via web. 
  - **Root cause:** Assumed/hallucinated a URL instead of verifying it exists
  - **Lesson:** Never cite specific URLs without confirming they're real — especially for private infrastructure
  - **Fix applied:** Updated `memory/projects/connected-driving-pipeline.md` with warning note
