# 🛠️ Improvements: 2026-02-11

## Reflection Summary

First self-reflection session! Ran Counsel analysis (🟠 Elevated) on the systems we built tonight.

## Changes Made

### Created: `memory/counsel/INDEX.md`
- **Change:** Decision history tracking for precedent lookup
- **Reason:** Architect noted no way to query "have we decided this before?"
- **Validates:** Will track if decisions get revisited

### Updated: `docs/THE-CIRCLE.md`
- **Change 1:** Added escalation triggers table
- **Reason:** Skeptic noted escalation criteria were subjective ("vibes")
- **Example:** Security → 🟠 Elevated minimum

- **Change 2:** Added quorum rules for Counsel
- **Reason:** Architect asked "what if 3 of 7 agents fail?"
- **Validation:** Will track partial failures

- **Change 3:** Added dissent protocol
- **Reason:** Skeptic warned about groupthink, false consensus
- **Example:** 2+ dissenters → flag for human review

- **Change 4:** Added human feedback hierarchy
- **Reason:** Skeptic noted "who wins: self-assessment or human?"
- **Answer:** Human overrides self-assessment

### Updated: `docs/SELF-REFLECTION.md`
- **Change 1:** Added improvement validation section
- **Reason:** Skeptic asked "how do you know a fix worked?"
- **Example:** Check-in date, regression detection

- **Change 2:** Added human feedback priority
- **Reason:** Same as above — human > self

## Insights Added

None yet — this is our first session!

## Patterns Noticed

- 🟢 The Counsel process works well for self-analysis
- 🤔 Some sub-agents timed out — may need to adjust spawn timing
- 💡 "Think like a human" reframe was the key insight tonight

## Action Items

- [ ] Future: Add metrics/observability layer for Circle usage
- [ ] Future: Lesson durability tracking (re-validate learnings periodically)
- [ ] Future: End-of-conversation reflection prompt
