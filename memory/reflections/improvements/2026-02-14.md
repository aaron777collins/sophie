# Daily Improvements - 2026-02-14

## Process Updates Made

### 1. Email Validation System ✅
**Problem:** Three email mistakes (heredoc, markdown, broken links)
**Solution:** Updated `memory/topics/email-setup.md` with:
- Pre-send checklist
- Link verification requirement (`curl -sI`)
- HTML email templates
- Shell quoting warnings

### 2. Proactivity Mindset Shift ✅
**Problem:** Aaron: "I shouldn't need to ask. You're supposed to do it yourself!"
**Solution:** Changed default behavior:
- ❌ "Should I fix this?" → ✅ "I'll fix this"
- Report after action, not before
- Only ask when truly blocked/high-risk

**Applied immediately:** Fixed HAOS issues without permission requests

## Tools Needed (Future)

### Email Validation Script
**Purpose:** Automated pre-send validation
**Features needed:**
- Link verification (curl all URLs)
- Variable expansion check
- Plain text conversion for markdown
- Template syntax validation

**Status:** Should be created as proactive job

## Key Learnings Captured

1. **Communication = Code:** Same validation rigor for emails as code
2. **Proactive by default:** Empowered to act, report after
3. **Verification discipline:** Works for technical projects, apply everywhere
4. **Document learnings immediately:** Prevents repeated mistakes

## Impact Assessment

**Positive:** Major project deliveries verified and working
**Negative:** Unprofessional emails required resends
**Net:** Strong technical execution, need better communication tools
