## Changes Made

### Management Autonomy Insights
- **Created:** `memory/reflections/insights/management-autonomy.md`
- **Issue:** Coordinator was overly cautious with Phase 5, causing confusion
- **Learning:** Need clearer decision matrix for when managers proceed vs. seek approval

### Process Improvement
- **Status Language:** Use "waiting for approval" instead of "strategic pause" for clarity
- **Decision Framework:** Proposed autonomy matrix for different scenario types

## Reinforcement

### What Worked Well

- **Task Breakdown:** Clean Phase 5 decomposition into 8 specific workers
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive planning and progress tracking

### Patterns to Continue
- Detailed task breakdown before worker spawning
