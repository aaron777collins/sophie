# Process Improvements - 2026-02-20

## 🛠️ Tools to Build

### 1. Model Compatibility Checker
**Problem:** Haiku OAuth tokens don't have access to 3.5 models, causing 404 failures
**Solution:** Create automated checker when updating model configs
```bash
# Proposed tool: ~/clawd/tools/model-checker.sh
# Tests all model aliases in config before applying changes
```

### 2. Cache Validation Tools  
**Problem:** Cache keys missing config variables led to cross-configuration pollution
**Solution:** Standard validation for pipeline cache key completeness
```bash
# Proposed: cache-key-audit.py
# Scans caching code to ensure all config vars are in cache keys
```

### 3. Pre-flight Validation Suite
**Problem:** React hooks violations, ESLint errors discovered late in process
**Solution:** Automated checks before major releases
```bash
# Proposed: pre-flight-check.sh
# Runs build, lint, hooks validation, type checking
```

## 📋 Process Updates Needed

### Pipeline Creation Checklist
- [ ] Cache key validation completed
- [ ] All config variables included in cache keys  
- [ ] Test data compatibility verified
- [ ] Dashboard integration confirmed

### Model Configuration Updates
- [ ] Model compatibility tested with current auth
- [ ] Fallback models configured
- [ ] Access method documented (OAuth vs API key)

### Autonomous Work Standards
- [ ] Clear "done" criteria defined
- [ ] Validation steps mandatory
- [ ] Documentation updated during work
- [ ] Memory logs maintained with timestamps

## 🎯 Immediate Actions

1. **Document Haiku limitations** in `TOOLS.md` and credentials notes
2. **Create model testing script** for config updates
3. **Add cache validation** to pipeline setup workflow

## 🔄 Reinforcement Patterns

### Keep Doing
- Autonomous problem-solving when given clear direction
- Systematic audits when fixing issues (not just spot fixes)
- Comprehensive memory keeping during complex work
- Quality standards (zero TS errors, clean lint, full validation)

### Stop Doing  
- Waiting for permission on technical debt cleanup
- Spot fixes without checking for systemic issues
- Config changes without compatibility testing

### Start Doing
- Proactive audits before issues surface
- Standard validation checklists for common workflows
- Tool creation to prevent recurring manual work
