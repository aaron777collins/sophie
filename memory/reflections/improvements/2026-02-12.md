# Daily Improvements - 2026-02-12

## [23:00] Daily Reflection Process - First Run

### What Was Learned
- Circle analysis works well for identifying patterns across different lenses
- Technical documentation quality is strong when using systematic approaches
- Need better follow-through on performance anomalies

### Process Improvements Made
1. **Created insight pattern:** Technical debugging structure documented in `insights/technical-debugging.md`
2. **Identified gap:** Performance regression detection needs immediate investigation, not just notation

### Next Actions Needed
- Add proactive job to investigate ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 accuracy drop (99% → 18-50%)
- Create monitoring alerts for performance regressions
- Refine reflection process based on first run learnings

### Quality Reinforcement
- Continue systematic debugging documentation pattern
- Maintain comprehensive task completion documentation
- Keep exceeding delivery expectations on major work
