# Process Improvements - 2026-02-24

## Crisis Response Methodology Formalized
Based on today's successful issue resolution pattern:

### Standard Pipeline Crisis Response
1. **Rapid Diagnosis** (target: 15 minutes)
   - Check logs for obvious errors
   - Verify expected vs actual outputs
   - Identify root cause hypothesis

2. **Safe Backup**
   - Backup current working files before changes
   - Document current state and symptoms

3. **Targeted Fix**
   - Implement minimal viable fix
   - Document reasoning and trade-offs
   - Test locally if possible

4. **Clean Restart**
   - Clear affected artifacts/cache
   - Fresh environment for rerun
   - Monitor initial progress closely

5. **Documentation & Communication**
   - Real-time logging of decisions
   - Stakeholder notifications
   - Progress monitoring setup

## Architectural Documentation Needs
- Document singleton lifecycle management patterns
- Create testing framework for dependency injection
- Establish resource monitoring for large-scale operations

## Tool Development Priorities
1. **Pipeline Testing Framework** - Automated testing across dataset sizes
2. **Resource Monitor Dashboard** - Dask memory and performance tracking
3. **Singleton Testing Tools** - Validation framework for cache clearing
