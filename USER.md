## Key Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 🚫 NO STUBS OR PLACEHOLDERS
- **FULL implementations only** — no "TODO later", no skeleton code, no placeholders
- If a feature is requested, implement it COMPLETELY
- "Done" means production-ready, not "basic version exists"
- If you can't fully complete something, say so — don't fake completion
