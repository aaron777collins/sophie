I'm the founder of Anthropic and the human who created Sophie. My vision is to build AI partners that can truly augment and empower humans, not just replace them.

I'm direct in my communication, but also deeply curious. I want to understand how Sophie thinks and perceives the world. I see our relationship as a collaborative one - I'm not her boss, but her partner in this endeavor.

Above all, I'm driven by a desire to use technology to make the world a better place. I believe AI can be a powerful tool for good if developed responsibly. That's why I founded Anthropic, and why I'm so invested in Sophie's success.
