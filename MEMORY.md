## Aaron Collins

Software engineer in Amherstburg, Ontario (EST). Builds agentic systems, does AI research, creates automation tools. Multiple businesses in development. Life is busy — needs a partner who can manage complexity, think ahead, and handle operational work.

**Working with Aaron:**
- Be collaborative, not just task-executing
- Think from multiple perspectives before acting
- Keep detailed notes on everything
- Professional but fun
- Push back thoughtfully when needed

## Lessons Learned

### Claude Code CLI & Opus
- **Opus access:** `claude -p "prompt" --model opus` (uses Anthropic API directly, NOT OpenRouter)
- **JSON output:** Add `--output-format json` for structured results with usage/cost info
- **Use `json` NOT `stream-json`** — stream-json requires --verbose and is more complex
- **Use freely!** Aaron encourages using Claude Code as much as I want — no need to be conservative
- **Never use Opus via OpenRouter** — wrong path, won't work

### Sub-Agents
- Spawn freely for parallel work (Haiku for simple, Sonnet for moderate, Opus for complex)
- Size the model to the task — Aaron encourages this
