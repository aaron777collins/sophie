# Progress: p4-2: Code quality review for PortableRalph

## Task
**Task:** p4-2: Code quality review
**Project:** PortableRalph Production Readiness
**Repository:** https://github.com/aaron777collins/portableralph
**Parent:** Phase 4 (Production Hardening)
**Model:** sonnet
**Priority:** HIGH

## Objective
Comprehensive code quality review and improvements for production readiness.

## Project Directory
**CRITICAL:** Work in `/home/ubuntu/repos/portableralph/` (NOT ~/clawd/)

## Communication Log
- [2026-02-21 16:25 EST] Received task, beginning code quality review
- [2026-02-21 16:26 EST] Navigated to correct project directory

## Attempts
### Attempt 1 — 2026-02-21 16:25
- **Status:** completed
- **What I did:** 
  - Conducted comprehensive code quality review
  - Analyzed all scripts for style consistency, dead code, and best practices
  - Ran full test suite to ensure baseline functionality
  - Implemented systematic code quality improvements
  - Created comprehensive documentation

### Changes Implemented:
1. **Removed Dead Code:**
   - Deleted `ralph-full.ps1.backup` (obsolete backup file)
   - Cleaned up redundant help handling in `ralph.ps1` 
   - Improved TODO comment in test file (`test-security-fixes.sh`)

2. **Eliminated Code Duplication:**
   - Refactored `install.sh` to use shared `get_home_dir()` function from `lib/platform-utils.sh`
   - Maintained fallback for when library isn't available during installation

3. **Enhanced Documentation:**
   - Created `CODE_QUALITY_ANALYSIS.md` with detailed issue analysis
   - Created `CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` with comprehensive coding standards
   - Established guidelines for bash and PowerShell consistency

4. **Verified Best Practices:**
   - Confirmed proper use of shared validation libraries
   - Verified consistent variable naming conventions
   - Checked error handling patterns across scripts
   - Ensured all tests still pass after changes

## Acceptance Criteria Progress
- [x] Code style consistency check across all files
- [x] Remove dead/unused code and comments  
- [x] Verify proper error handling patterns
- [x] Check for code duplication and refactor if needed
- [x] Review variable naming and function structure
- [x] Ensure proper logging and debugging support
- [x] Verify all scripts follow best practices
- [x] Update code quality standards documentation
