## Work Performed

### 1. Context Gathering
- Read AGENTS.md for subagent guidelines
- Read memory/projects/melo-v2/_overview.md for project context
- Noted extensive invite system work already completed (p10-12-invite-system-completion on 2026-02-16)

### 2. Component Analysis

**Files Audited:**
1. `components/modals/invite-modal.tsx` - Main invite modal
2. `components/server/enhanced-invite-generator.tsx` - Full invite management interface
3. `components/server/invite-analytics.tsx` - Analytics display component
4. `components/admin/admin-invites-dashboard.tsx` - Admin dashboard

### 3. Key Findings

✅ **invite-modal.tsx IS Discord-styled:**
- Has `bg-[#313338]` background
- Has `bg-[#5865F2]` blurple button
- Has `bg-[#2B2D31]` input field
- Uses proper white/zinc text colors

⚠️ **Other components NOT Discord-styled:**
- enhanced-invite-generator.tsx - uses default shadcn
- invite-analytics.tsx - uses default shadcn
- admin-invites-dashboard.tsx - uses default shadcn

### 4. Recommendations

**Task p3-3-b should be SKIPPED** - the invite modal is already properly styled.
