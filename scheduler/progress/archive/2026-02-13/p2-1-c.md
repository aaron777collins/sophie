## Work Log
- [22:30] Started: Task claimed, reading context and dependencies
- [22:30] Context gathered: p2-1-a completed (server sidebar), need to create navigation-action.tsx
- [22:31] Discovered navigation-action.tsx already exists with basic implementation
- [22:32] Analyzed existing navigation components to understand styling patterns
- [22:33] Verified modal system - useModal hook and CreateServerModal work correctly
- [22:34] Enhanced navigation-action.tsx to match exact styling patterns from navigation-item.tsx
- [22:35] Fixed transition timing (duration-200 ease-in-out) and background consistency
