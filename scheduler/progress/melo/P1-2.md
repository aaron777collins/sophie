# Matrix.org Quick Toggle for Sign-Up Page (P1-2)

## Task Overview
- **Objective**: Add a toggle button to quickly switch to matrix.org public homeserver
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Branch**: `feature/P1-2-matrix-org-toggle`

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes
- Added `useMatrixOrgHomeserver` state to manage matrix.org toggle
- Implemented conditional rendering and state management for toggle
- Updated styling to match existing UI patterns
- Maintained existing invite code logic and validation flows

### Specific Additions
1. New toggle button in sign-up page
   - Checkbox/toggle with custom styling
   - Disables custom homeserver input when active
   - Resets invite code when toggled
   - Integrated with existing Matrix auth context

### UI/UX Considerations
- Toggle visually clear and consistent with existing dark theme
- Provides quick access to public matrix.org homeserver
- Prevents invite code input when using matrix.org
- Maintains all existing validation and error handling

### Validation Flow
- When matrix.org toggle active:
  - Locks homeserver to "https://matrix.org"
  - Disables custom homeserver input
  - Clears invite code
  - Handles invite requirement logic dynamically

## Testing
- Verified toggle works in both public and private mode configurations
- Confirmed no regressions in existing signup flow
- Validated state management and homeserver switching
- Tested with and without invite code requirements

## Next Potential Improvements
- Consider adding more public homeserver options
- Add more prominent matrix.org benefits/explanation text
- Potentially store user preference for matrix.org in local storage
