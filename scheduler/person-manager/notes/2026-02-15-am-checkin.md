## Status: ✅ HEALTHY

### System Health
- **Inbox:** Empty
- **Heartbeats:** 1 active (p9-6-code-highlighting, just spawned)
- **Worker Slots:** 1/2 used
- **Recent Completions:** p11-12, p12-9, p10-4, p11-2 all finished overnight

### HAOS Progress (Phases 8-12)
- **Phase 8:** 2/3 complete (p8-3 pending, optional)
- **Phase 9:** 3/8 complete + p9-6 in-progress
- **Phase 10:** 6/14 complete
- **Phase 11:** Some tasks done (p11-1, p11-2, p11-12)
- **Phase 12:** p12-9 complete

### Recent Activity (Overnight)
- ✅ p10-4-role-assignment completed - Full member role management
- ✅ p11-2-profile-settings completed - Profile editing with Matrix sync
- ✅ p12-9-error-boundaries completed - Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ p11-12-mobile-audit completed - Found critical settings page issue

### Key Finding from Mobile Audit
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Settings pages completely unusable on mobile (240px fixed sidebar on 320px screens). This blocks mobile users from any settings access. Should be prioritized.

### Observations
1. Workers executing well with good completion rate
2. Some 404 errors on old model "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022" — need to update spawn configs to use "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
3. p9-6 is Haiku task, may need monitoring for quality

### Next Actions
- Task Manager cron will spawn additional workers at capacity
- p10-5-role-badges now unblocked (p10-4 done)
- Mobile navigation (p11-13) ready to start with clear fix plan

### No Issues Requiring Escalation
System running smoothly. Weekend execution proceeding as expected.
