## Issues Found

1. **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md outdated** — Only shows 7 completed tasks, but 25+ are actually done
2. **Worker slots empty (0/2)** — No workers running despite pending work
3. **Coordinator JOBS.md stale** — Still lists tasks as pending that are completed

## Actions Completed

1. ✅ Document findings (this file)
2. ✅ Spawned Coordinator to update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with accurate status
3. ✅ Queued next batch of pending tasks (p11-13 mobile nav, p11-1 settings, p9-7, p8-3)
4. ✅ Workers running on 2/2 slots:
   - `melo-p11-13-mobile-navigation` (Sonnet) — actively running
   - `melo-p11-1-settings-layout` (Sonnet) — actively running
5. ✅ Reported to Slack

## Resolution (12:08 EST)

Coordinator updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md which triggered cron to spawn workers. System healthy — 2/2 slots now filled with high-priority MELO work.
