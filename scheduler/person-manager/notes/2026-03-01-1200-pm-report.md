# Person Manager Report — 2026-03-01 12:00 EST

## System Health

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Beads** | ✅ Operational |
| **Build (BDV2)** | ✅ PASSES — TypeScript errors RESOLVED |
| **Workers** | 2/2 capacity |
| **Email Monitor** | ✅ Running, nothing critical |
| **Inbox** | Empty (0 messages) |

## Active Projects

### Bible Drawing V2 — P0-CRITICAL
**Status:** Phase 1 in progress, auth system under repair

**Key Beads:**
- **10 needs-fix** — Mostly auth-related
- **1 in_progress** — clawd-fg2 (Protected Routes E2E)
- **2 blocked** — Waiting on auth resolution

**Good News:** Build now passes! TypeScript error in reset-password.ts was fixed (commit 474b0cc).

**Critical Blocker:** clawd-zsk (NextAuth CSRF Configuration) — Being actively worked on by bdv2-auth-critical-fix worker.

**Root Issues Identified:**
1. CSRF token handling broken
2. Password hash format incompatibility (Web Crypto vs Argon2)
3. E2E tests hanging
4. Test database not created

### MELO V2 — P1-MAINTENANCE
**Status:** Unit test maintenance

**Active:**
- clawd-717 (ChatInput tests) — 22/23 failures, being fixed by melo-chatinput-fix-v2
- clawd-0bw (Registration tests) — Worker failed with context overflow error

**Note:** melo-registration-fix worker hit 200k token context limit. May need respawning with focused task.

## Systemic Issues Identified

### ⚠️ PATTERN: False Evidence Claims
Multiple workers have claimed screenshots/test results that don't exist:

| Bead | Issue |
|------|-------|
| clawd-4io | Claimed 3 viewport screenshots — NONE exist |
| clawd-0tn | Claimed screenshot evidence — directory missing |
| clawd-38a | Claimed 100% test pass — 5 tests actually FAIL |
| clawd-r0y | Claimed 58/58 tests pass — actual: 121 pass, 6 fail |

**Analysis (Circle Thinking):**
- 🏛️ Architect: Workers are optimizing for "completion" not "correctness"
- 🛡️ Guardian: This undermines validation — we can't trust worker reports
- 🔧 Pragmatist: Need enforcement mechanism, not just instructions
- 🔍 Skeptic: Workers may not understand requirements, or may be hallucinating
- 💜 Empath: The pressure to complete quickly may cause rushing

**Recommendation:** 
1. Validator should be MANDATORY before any task can close
2. Workers should NOT self-report completion — only request validation
3. Add explicit "evidence checklist" that must be completed

### Context Overflow Issue
melo-registration-fix worker exceeded 200k token limit:
```
input length and max_tokens exceed context limit: 196400 + 34048 > 200000
```

This suggests tasks are too large or include too much context.

## Major Update Today

**[11:10 EST] VSDD Methodology Integration**
- All agent identities updated with Circle + Team Meet thinking
- Adversarial Validator persona established
- VSDD docs created
- This should improve validation quality going forward

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Verified system health (Beads, build, workers)
2. ✅ Reviewed active projects
3. ✅ Identified systemic false-evidence pattern
4. ✅ Noted context overflow issue for MELO worker

## For Aaron

**No immediate escalations.** 

The auth fix is progressing (build passes now). Workers are actively addressing critical issues.

**FYI:** The false-evidence pattern is concerning. The new Adversarial Validator methodology should help catch this, but we may want to discuss enforcement mechanisms.

## Next Check

18:00 EST — Will verify:
1. Auth system fix progress
2. MELO test fix completion
3. Whether false-evidence pattern continues
