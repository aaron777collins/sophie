## Organization Health

### 1. Melo V2 ✅ COMPLETE
- **Status:** Fixed and verified by Sophie at 12:57 EST
- Sign-in and sign-up pages render fully
- No action needed

### 2. Connected Driving Simulation Matrix 🔄 RUNNING
- **Currently Running:** Job 20260220_230639 (Run100kmBasic.py) — 2h 54m runtime
- **Queued:** 17 jobs (all 18 configs now queued with cache bug fix)
- **Cache fix:** Applied successfully, re-run coordinator completed
- **Status:** Healthy, running as expected

### 3. PortableRalph Windows CI ❌ STILL FAILING
- **Latest Workflow:** Run 22246047870 — FAILED
- **Issue:** Integration test failing
- **Root Cause:** `ralph.ps1 --help` fails on Windows
  - ✅ PowerShell available
  - ✅ Core scripts found (ralph.ps1, install.ps1, notify.ps1)
  - ❌ ralph.ps1 help functionality fails

**Analysis:** The p3-4-comprehensive-fix improved diagnostics (launcher.bat --test now properly detects issues) but didn't fix the underlying ralph.ps1 Windows compatibility issue. The script fails when running --help on Windows.

**Action Needed:** Debug why ralph.ps1 --help fails on Windows. Likely a PowerShell compatibility issue.

### 4. Model Configuration Issue
- **Error:** "claude-3-5-haiku-latest" model not found (404)
- **Impact:** Some cron jobs failing silently
- **Fix Needed:** Update config to use "claude-3-haiku-20240307"
- **Note:** Sophie already fixed this earlier per `2026-02-20-haiku-model-fix.md`
