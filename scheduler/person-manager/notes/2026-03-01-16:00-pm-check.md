# Person Manager Check — 2026-03-01 16:00 EST

## Circle Thinking Assessment

### 🏛️ Architect
- System architecture is sound
- Quality gates in place with enforcement scripts
- Test infrastructure fixed (clawd-lbk completed)
- Unit tests now passing on BDV2 (149/157, 8 integration tests properly skipped)

### 🛡️ Guardian
- No security concerns
- No external influences requiring action
- Quality gates properly enforced after 2026-03-01 false completion incident

### 🔮 Visionary
- VSDD methodology implemented
- Quality gate automation created
- Main session researching LiveKit for voice interface (Aaron's direction)

### 🔍 Skeptic
- BDV2 still has 9 needs-fix issues (auth system)
- clawd-zsk (CSRF fix) still needs-fix - is the blocker
- BUT: Work is active (clawd-8cu updated today)
- Question: Are we making progress or spinning wheels?

### 💜 Empath
- Aaron engaged (researching voice integration)
- Team functioning normally
- All cron jobs returning healthy status
