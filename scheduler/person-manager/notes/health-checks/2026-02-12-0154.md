## Issues Found

### 🔴 CRITICAL: No Workers Running
- **Heartbeats folder:** EMPTY
- **Active slots:** 0 of 2
- **Impact:** Work has stopped despite available tasks

### 🟡 Out-of-Sync Documentation
- Manager progress file showed p1-2-c as "pending" but it's actually complete
- **Fixed:** Updated `_manager.md` during this audit

### 🟢 Good: Previous Cleanup Effective
- Old orphaned heartbeat (p2-1-a.json) was cleaned up
- System is clean, just not running

---

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Updated manager progress file (p1-2-c marked complete)
2. ✅ Identified p1-2-d as ready to spawn
3. ⏳ Need to restart work pipeline

## Recommendations

1. **Spawn p1-2-d worker immediately** — Task is unblocked, hooks are ready
2. **Check cron scheduler** — Is the 15-min proactive scheduler running?
3. **Consider spawning p1-2-e after d completes** — Can parallelize at 2 slots

---

## Next Steps

The p1-2-d task (useRoom hook) should be spawned. It has:
- All dependencies met (b and c complete)
- Clear deliverables (hooks/use-room.ts)
- Defined success criteria

Once d is in progress, the pipeline resumes.
