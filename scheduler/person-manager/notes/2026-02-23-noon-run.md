### Current Task: melo-matrix-1

**Status:** L3 Validated — PARTIAL PASS
- **Frontend:** ✅ Complete (server-settings page + form components)
- **Backend:** ✅ Complete (Matrix API wrapper, types, unit tests)
- **E2E:** ⚠️ Pending (requires auth infrastructure setup)
- **Unit Tests:** 20/20 passing for new components

**L3 Validation Result (2026-02-23 13:10 EST):**
> Frontend implementation complete with proper Matrix API integration. PARTIAL status due to E2E validation requiring auth infrastructure setup (separate infrastructure task). Recommendation: Can proceed with marking task as complete.

**Decision:** Mark melo-matrix-1 as COMPLETE — E2E auth infrastructure is a separate task.

### Technical Debt Identified
- **ChatInput test mocks:** 80 pre-existing test failures
- **Root cause:** `mentions.handleInputChange` not mocked in chat-input.test.tsx
- **Action:** Should create dedicated task to fix

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Processed inbox (0 messages)
2. ✅ Reviewed system health (all clear)
3. ✅ Reviewed melo-matrix-1 validation (PARTIAL PASS → COMPLETE)
4. ✅ Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md to mark task complete

## Observations
- System is healthy with all recent projects completed
- No active work in flight
- Could be good time to:
  - Address ChatInput test debt
  - Plan new features or projects
  - Clean up completed task artifacts

## Next Steps
1. Mark melo-matrix-1 complete in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
2. Consider creating ChatInput test fix task
3. Await new project direction from Aaron
