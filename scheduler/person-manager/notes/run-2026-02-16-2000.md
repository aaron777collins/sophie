## System Check

### HAOS-v2 Build Status
- **FOUND BUILD BROKEN** — TypeScript errors introduced by recent worker commits
- **FIXED ALL ERRORS** — 6 files modified

#### Issues Fixed
1. **Service Worker Type Collision** (`lib/pwa/service-worker-registration.ts`, `hooks/use-service-worker.tsx`)
   - Custom `ServiceWorkerRegistration` interface shadowed global browser type
   - Renamed to `ServiceWorkerManagerAPI` and used `globalThis.ServiceWorkerRegistration` for native type
   - Fixed `register()` return type: `Promise<void>` → `Promise<globalThis.ServiceWorkerRegistration | undefined>`

2. **Request Logger Issues** (`lib/logging/request-logger.ts`)
   - Duplicate object properties `service` and `environment` in constructor
   - Missing `debug` color in colors object
   - Map iteration incompatibility with TypeScript target
   - Config type missing required properties

3. **Sentry Integration** (`lib/monitoring/sentry-integration.ts`)
   - Missing type annotation on `beforeSend` callback parameters

### Commit
- Committed fix: `5265133` — "fix: TypeScript build errors in service worker, logging, and sentry integration"
- Push blocked (repo remote points to nayak-nirmalya's fork, not Aaron's)

## Progress Assessment

### HAOS Completion Status
- **Phase 10:** 100% COMPLETE ✅
- **Phase 11:** 100% COMPLETE ✅  
- **Phase 12:** ~75% (~4 tasks remaining)
- **Overall:** ~93% complete

### Worker Queue
- 0/2 slots occupied (queue idle)
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md shows tasks recently completed

## Issues Identified
1. **Git remote issue** — repo can't push to origin (permission denied to fork)
2. **Worker code quality** — Workers introduced multiple TypeScript errors that broke build
   - Need to reinforce: **BUILD MUST PASS** before marking tasks complete

## Recommendations
1. Fix git remote to point to Aaron's repo
2. Add build verification to worker task completion
3. Consider CI/CD enforcement of type checks

## Coordinator Strategic Decision (Noted)
Per Coordinator assessment at 18:30 EST:
- Project at ~95% completion (updated from earlier 75% estimate)
- Empty queue is **intentional** — project at natural milestone
- Next phase should be strategic (testing, deployment) not tactical (features)
- Coordinator recommends: final integration testing, security audit, deployment prep

## Person Manager Assessment
**CONCUR** with Coordinator's strategic assessment. HAOS-v2 has reached MVP completion:
- All core phases (8-11) complete
- Infrastructure (Phase 12) substantially complete
- Major features: E2EE, PWA, monitoring, documentation implemented

### Next Strategic Phase
- Final integration testing
- Production deployment preparation
- User acceptance testing
- Consider beta launch timeline
