### ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 — NEEDS RESTART

**Status:** ⚠️ STOPPED (not running)

#### Key Findings

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Completed** | 75/108 (69%) |
| **Failed** | 1 (`movementWithAll3Ids_2km_randoffset`) |
| **Remaining** | 32 pipelines |
| **Disk Space** | 174G/420G used (44%) — HEALTHY |
| **Process** | NOT RUNNING |

#### Issue

The 08:00 morning check reported the pipeline as running, but inspection at 12:00 shows:
- **No active pipeline process** (only dashboard server running)
- **Log ends at 01:04 EST** with the disk full error
- **Count stuck at 75** (was at 75 before, should have progressed if running)

The pipeline was NOT restarted after disk space was freed.

#### Timeline
- **Feb 26 01:04 EST** - Pipeline failed (disk full at 85/108 attempt)
- **Feb 26 ~sometime** - Disk space freed (~249GB)
- **Feb 26 08:00 EST** - Morning check incorrectly reported as running
- **Feb 26 12:00 EST** - Confirmed pipeline NOT running
