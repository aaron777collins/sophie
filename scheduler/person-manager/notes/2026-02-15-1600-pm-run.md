- p8-3-encryption-ui ✅

### 🔴 Build Issue Found & Fixed

- **Error:** Type `boolean | "" | undefined` not assignable to `boolean | undefined`
- **Fix:** Added `!!` to coerce boolean expression
- **Status:** Build rerunning to verify fix

### PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Status
- Shows "No Active Tasks" — all current work completed

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Read and processed 3 inbox messages
2. ✅ Archived processed messages
3. ✅ Verified Phase 8 completion
4. ✅ Fixed TypeScript build error in security-prompt-modal.tsx

## Observations

The Coordinator's earlier escalations about "critical issues" and "sync problems" appear to have been resolved by subsequent work. The system is now in a stable state with Phase 8 complete and the task queue properly synced.

## Build Fixes Applied & Committed

**Commit:** `408a543` — "fix: resolve TypeScript errors in security-prompt-modal and use-slowmode"

**Changes:**
1. Fixed boolean type coercion in `security-prompt-modal.tsx` (line 201)
2. Moved `use-slowmode.ts` from `src/hooks/` to `hooks/` for correct path resolution
3. Added `types/channel.ts` for `SlowmodeSettings` type

**Push:** Successfully pushed to `aaron` remote (github.com/aaron777collins/haos)

## System Health

✅ Build passes with only ESLint warnings (minor)
✅ Phase 8 complete (3/3 tasks)
✅ Task queue synchronized
✅ No workers needed (no pending tasks)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Build verified passing
2. ✅ Fix committed and pushed
3. Assess remaining phases 9-12 for next work cycle
4. Consider populating PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with remaining high-priority tasks
