## Inbox Review

Processed 3 messages from Coordinator:

### 1. Fraud Claim (clawd-pc8) - RESOLVED
- **Original claim:** Worker fabricated evidence for DM Sidebar task
- **Investigation:** PROACTIVE-JOBS.md already documented this was FALSE
- **Evidence:** 
  - Commit `ddf7b8b` EXISTS
  - DM components implemented correctly
  - 5/5 unit tests passing
- **Status:** Task clawd-pc8 closed as complete
- **Action:** Archived message, no further action needed

### 2. Multi-Layer Validation Failure (clawd-zsk) - IN PROGRESS
- **Issue:** Authentication CSRF configuration broken in Bible Drawing V2
- **Root cause:** E2E tests failing, screenshot evidence missing
- **Impact:** Auth tasks blocked (clawd-6pb, clawd-ebr)
- **Status:** clawd-zsk in `needs-fix` status (P0)
- **Action:** Work is already properly tracked and being addressed

### 3. Matrix Integration Alert (clawd-pc8) - SUPERSEDED
- **Issue:** Matrix client crypto initialization failures
- **Status:** This predates the fraud claim resolution
- **Note:** clawd-pc8 is now closed, so this is outdated
- **Action:** Archived

- No "conditional passes" in recent validator notes
- E2E tests ARE being tracked (clawd-zsk shows E2E failures properly flagged)
- Infrastructure issues being used as blockers → tracked properly
- Unit-E2E gap identified and being addressed
