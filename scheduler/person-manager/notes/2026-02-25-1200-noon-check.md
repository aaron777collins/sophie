**System Status: HEALTHY** ✅

- Pipeline progressing smoothly (+5 completions since morning)
- No blocked work
- No escalations
- All recent projects validated and closed
- Personnel warnings being monitored (no new incidents)

## Strategic Notes

1. **Wyoming pipeline** is the current priority - let it run, Sophie monitoring
2. **Post-pipeline:** Consider whether new projects are queued
3. **Personnel:** Watch Coordinator and Validator for improvement before warning periods end

## Next Actions

1. Evening check at 18:00 EST
2. Monitor for any escalations
3. Pipeline should be ~70-80% complete by then
