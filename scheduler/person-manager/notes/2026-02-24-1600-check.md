## Actions Taken
- Reviewed system status
- Verified pipeline is actively running
- No issues requiring intervention

## Note on Documentation Discrepancy
PROACTIVE-JOBS.md states 162 pipelines and 52/162 completed, but actual progress.json shows:
- Total: 108 pipelines
- Completed: 15/108

The 162 number may have been from an earlier configuration plan. Current reality is 108 pipelines. Documentation should be updated when Sophie completes the run.
