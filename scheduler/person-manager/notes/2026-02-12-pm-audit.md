# Person Manager Audit — 2026-02-12 02:58 EST

## Summary
Regular health check of the organization.

## Inbox
- **1 message processed:** Chain test result from Coordinator (2026-02-11 23:40 UTC)
  - Result: Coordinator ran full chain test, spawn queue worked
  - Action: Archived to inbox/archive/

## Heartbeats
- **None active** — no sessions currently running (expected between cron runs)

## Organization Health

### Coordinator JOBS.md
- ✅ Active project: melo-v2 (Phase 1 - Core Integration)
- Status: Healthy, work progressing

### PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Analysis
- **melo-v2 Phase 1:**
  - p1-1 (Auth): ✅ Complete (5/5)
  - p1-2 (Sync): 🚀 In Progress (5/10) — CORRECTED from "3/10"
  - p1-3 (Media): ⏳ Pending (0/8)
  - p1-4 (Services): ⏳ Pending (0/6)

### Discrepancy Found & Fixed
**Issue:** Manager file `scheduler/progress/melo-v2-sync-manager-p1-2/_manager.md` was out of date:
- Listed p1-2-d and p1-2-e as "in-progress" / "pending"
- Progress files showed both as COMPLETED
- Verified files exist in repo: `/home/ubuntu/repos/melo-v2/hooks/`
  - use-matrix-client.ts ✓
  - use-room.ts ✓
  - use-room-messages.ts ✓

**Actions Taken:**
1. Updated _manager.md to show all 5 sub-tasks complete
2. Corrected PROACTIVE-JOBS.md progress table (3/10 → 5/10)
3. Added note about remaining p1-2 tasks (f, g, h, i, j)

## Next Work Available
p1-2 has 5 more tasks remaining:
- p1-2-f: useTypingIndicator Hook
- p1-2-g: usePresence Hook
- p1-2-h: useReadReceipts Hook
- p1-2-i: Connection Status Component
- p1-2-j: Remove Socket.io Dependencies

No blockers. Coordinator can continue spawning workers for these.

## Recommendations
1. Continue p1-2 work (next: f, g, h can start in parallel)
2. System is healthy - no intervention needed
3. Spawn queue is empty (as expected when no active work)
