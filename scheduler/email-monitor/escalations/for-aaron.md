# Items for Aaron's Attention

**Purpose:** Things the email monitor flagged that need Aaron's review/decision.

---

## Pending Review

<!-- Add items here as they come in -->
| Date | From | Subject | Priority | Why Flagged | Status |
|------|------|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| | | | | | |

---

## Acknowledged

<!-- Move items here after Aaron reviews -->
| Date | From | Resolution |
|------|------|------------|

---

## How This Works

1. Email Monitor flags something → adds to "Pending Review"
2. Aaron reviews → either resolves or delegates
3. Move to "Acknowledged" with resolution
4. Clean old acknowledged items weekly
