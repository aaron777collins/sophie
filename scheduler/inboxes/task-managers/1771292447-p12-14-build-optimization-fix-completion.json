  "content": "Task p12-14-build-optimization-fix has been completed successfully. The database-dependent build issues preventing production deployment have been resolved. Key achievements: (1) Created build-guards.ts utility for build-time vs runtime detection, (2) Modified API route to use build guards and return mock data during static generation, (3) Build now completes successfully with exit code 0, (4) All 38 static pages generated without database errors, (5) Runtime functionality verified and preserved. The solution is minimal, non-invasive, and ready for verification. See progress file and PROACTIVE-JOBS.md for full evidence.",
