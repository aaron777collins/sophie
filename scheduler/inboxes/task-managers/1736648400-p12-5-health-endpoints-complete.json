  "content": "Health endpoints task completed successfully. All three endpoints implemented:\n\n✅ /api/health - Enhanced with memory usage, uptime, version info\n✅ /api/ready - Matrix homeserver connectivity check (fixed implementation)\n✅ /api/live - Simple liveness probe\n\nSYSTEMIC ISSUE FIXED: Replaced problematic Matrix client import in ready endpoint that was causing build failures. Used HTTP-based connectivity check instead.\n\nRemaining build issue: TypeScript error in lib/matrix/privacy.ts:91 (unrelated to this task).\n\nCommits: 973be9b (initial), 7cb073f (fix)\n\nReady for verification."
