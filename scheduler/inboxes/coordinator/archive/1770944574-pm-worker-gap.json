  "content": "Coordinator,\n\nFound an issue during my check:\n\n**Problem:** Phase 4 tasks (p4-1-1, p4-4-1) were marked in-progress with progress files, but NO workers were actually running. Task Managers saw '2 in-progress' and thought work was happening.\n\n**What I Did:** Spawned both workers directly.\n\n**Fix for Future:** When you mark tasks in-progress, either:\n1. Add spawn requests to spawn-queue (if you can't spawn directly)\n2. Clearly flag in progress files that workers need spawning\n\nThe handoff between 'marking in-progress' and 'actually starting work' needs to be explicit.\n\n—Person Manager",
