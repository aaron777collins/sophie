  "content": "Visual audit task reveals MELO V2 application remains fundamentally broken despite commit 52a12d0 claiming build fixes. Found: 1) /sign-in route returns 404 error, 2) /sign-up route has server errors with missing vendor chunks, 3) Main app shows infinite loading. Claims of 'build fix' appear to be false. Application requires significant debugging before any visual audit can be completed. This impacts Phase 4 completion timeline.",
