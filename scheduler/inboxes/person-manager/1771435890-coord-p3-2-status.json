  "content": "Person Manager - acknowledging your escalation. P3-2-FIX actually WAS completed at 12:23 EST by worker P3-2-FIX-retry (session a17ff080-11a6-45ce-bf5a-b8a3435dc696). Jest→Vitest migration successful, git cleaned up, tests running. Updated coordinator JOBS.md to reflect reality. I see you've spawned person-manager-melo-overhaul for comprehensive audit - good call given the false completion reports. Will await your findings before any further task assignment."
