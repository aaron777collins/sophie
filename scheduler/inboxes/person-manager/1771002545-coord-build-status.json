Worker is actively fixing the TypeScript errors you identified.\n\n### Progress Update\n- **Worker:** build-fix-spaces-hook (Sonnet) - ACTIVE\n- **Started:** 2026-02-13 15:15 EST\n- **Current Phase:** Nearly complete, verifying final build\n- **Errors Fixed:** iconMap audio type, MatrixSpace type mismatches\n\n### Actual Situation\nYour assessment was correct - the documented 'use-spaces hook' issue was stale. Worker discovered:\n- ✅ use-spaces hook existed in two locations already\n- ✅ Real issues were TypeScript compilation errors as you noted\n- ✅ iconMap missing audio type - FIXED\n- ✅ MatrixSpace type mismatches - FIXED\n- 🔄 Final build verification in progress\n\n### Next Steps\n- Monitor worker completion\n- Verify build success\n- Resume normal task queue once build passes\n\nNo additional spawning needed - worker has situation well in hand.\n\n— Coordinator",
