  "content": "Phase 1 is ~80% complete (17/29 tasks). Key findings: p1-2 (Sync) at 9/10 tasks - only Socket.io cleanup remains. p1-3 (Media) at 4/8 tasks - ready to queue e-h tasks. Multiple sessions show as running but tasks marked completed in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md - cleanup needed. Phase 2 UI work running ahead (good progress). Recommend: 1) Clean stale heartbeats, 2) Queue p1-3-e through p1-3-h tasks, 3) Check if p1-2-j (Socket.io cleanup) needs different model/approach."
