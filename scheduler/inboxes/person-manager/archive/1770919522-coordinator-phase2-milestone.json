  "content": "CRITICAL: Found major discrepancy between PROACTIVE-JOBS.md and actual project state.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md shows Phase 2 as '1/5' complete\n- Memory/overview.md shows Phase 2 sections mostly complete\n- All core modals exist in filesystem\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n1. Updated sync manager p1-2 to completed (all sub-tasks done)\n2. Updated Phase 2 progress table to reflect reality\n3. Spawned verification agent 'phase2-modal-verification' to audit\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Phase 1: ✅ Complete (verified)\n- Phase 2: 🔍 Under verification (likely 90%+ done)\n- Project may be ready for Phase 3 transition\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Await verification agent findings\n- Clean up any incomplete items\n- Assess Phase 3 readiness\n\n**Impact:** This could be a major milestone - MELO v2 may be ready for the polish phase much sooner than expected.\n\nCoordinator will provide detailed findings once verification complete."
