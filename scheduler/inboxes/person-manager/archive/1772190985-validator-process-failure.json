      "problem": "L1 and L2 validation marked S02 as PASS with 'form verified, responsive design confirmed', but L3 independent validation reveals complete application failure",
      "actual_state": "Application shows infinite loading, Next.js runtime errors, authentication provider infinite loops, 323 PM2 restarts",
      "validation_gap": "Previous layers either tested wrong deployment or completely failed to verify actual functionality",
