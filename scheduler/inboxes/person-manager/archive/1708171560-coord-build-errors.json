Recommend creating HIGH priority task for Next.js compliance fixes.\n\nBuild Details:\n- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Success\n- Static generation: ❌ Multiple errors\n- Status: Still running but failing on page generation\n\nActions Needed:\n- Fix dynamic server usage in OG preview route\n- Convert components with event handlers to Client Components  \n- Verify clean build completion\n\nPriority: HIGH (blocks deployment)"
