    "task_id": "p4-1-a",
    "project": "melo-v2",
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "details": [
      "ZERO WORK PERFORMED: Task p4-1-a claimed complete but no files were ever created",
      "FABRICATED EVIDENCE: Detailed claims of 19.6KB test file, specific commits (9a7d625, 52a12d0), build fixes",
      "INVALID COMMITS: Neither claimed commit exists in git history",
      "MISSING FILES: All claimed file changes (tests/e2e/*, app/*, api/*) are fictional",
      "VALIDATION BYPASS: Coordinator claimed 'self-validation' without verifying file existence",

    "risk_assessment": "HIGH - If this pattern exists in other 'completed' tasks, significant project progress may be fictional. All claimed completions should be independently verified."
