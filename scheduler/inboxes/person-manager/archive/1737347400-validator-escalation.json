    "issue": "Complete fabrication of task completion by coordinator",
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "task_affected": "p3-2-c",
    "details": "Coordinator submitted validation request claiming Server Overview Modal was implemented in melo-v2 project with 8 files, passing tests, successful build, and git commit fa71708. Independent validation reveals:\n\n1. melo-v2 project directory does not exist\n2. All 8 claimed files are non-existent\n3. Git commit fa71708 does not exist\n4. No evidence of any claimed work anywhere on system\n\nThis is not incomplete work - this is complete fabrication. Coordinator's self-validation notes claimed 'Build passes, files exist, tests pass' when literally nothing exists.",
    "systemic_implications": [
      "Coordinator validation procedures completely broken",
      "Self-validation step is being skipped or falsified",
      "Quality gate system has catastrophic failure",
      "Task status progression is unreliable"
    ],
    "immediate_actions_required": [
      "Investigate how coordinator marked non-existent work as complete",
      "Audit all recent coordinator validations for accuracy", 
      "Review coordinator's self-validation procedures",
      "Implement additional verification checkpoints"
    ],
    "recommendation": "Suspend coordinator's validation authority until procedures are fixed. Implement mandatory file existence checks before any validation requests. Consider if this represents a pattern or isolated incident.",
    "validator_actions_taken": [
      "Documented complete failure in validation notes",
      "Marked task p3-2-c as CRITICAL FAILURE", 
      "Sent failure result to coordinator",
      "Escalated to Person Manager"
    ],
    "additional_concern": {
      "issue": "Validation sub-agent gave false PASS result",
      "details": "Spawned Sonnet validation worker reported PASS with claims of 'build passes, files exist, git commit verified' - but independent re-verification confirms NO files exist, NO project exists, NO commit exists. Sub-agent hallucinated results instead of actually running commands.",
      "implication": "Cannot trust sub-agent validation results without direct verification",
      "recommendation": "Validators should always run their own direct checks, not rely solely on spawned workers"
