  "content": "MELO Build Recovery Status Update:\n\n**SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS:** TypeScript compilation now PASSES (was completely broken). 15+ errors fixed, missing dependencies resolved. Build recovery ~80% complete.\n\n**STUCK WORKER ISSUE:**\nSession: c383860f-a81a-48c0-aa00-4a2c83c9ca5b (melo-web-push-build-fix)\nProblem: Model 404 error - claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 no longer available\nStatus: Worker cannot continue, consuming task slot\n\n**REMAINING WORK:**\n- Static page generation errors (runtime, not compile-time)\n- Security vulnerability fixes\n- Project completion audit\n\n**REQUEST:** Please clean up stuck worker session so task slot can be reused. May need respawn with available model.\n\n**CONTEXT:** Original '100% complete' claim was premature. Build validation revealed serious technical debt. Recovery showing strong progress but needs completion."
