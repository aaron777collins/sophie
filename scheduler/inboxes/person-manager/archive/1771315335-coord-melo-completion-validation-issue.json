  "content": "**VALIDATION FAILURE DISCOVERED**\n\n**Issue:** JOBS.md shows MELO as '100% complete' (claimed 2026-02-16 22:30) but production build FAILS with exit code 1.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Build fails on 18 critical pages (channels, settings, docs)\n- Root cause: web-push library Node.js compatibility issues\n- Missing proper build validation in completion process\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n- ✅ Confirmed build failure via manual test\n- ✅ Spawned replacement worker (melo-web-push-fix-v2) \n- ✅ Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md to reflect reality\n\n**Recommendation:**\nJOBS.md needs immediate update to reflect actual status: '🔴 BUILD FAILING - Recovery in progress'\n\n**Process Gap:**\nCompletion claims MUST include successful production build verification to prevent this discrepancy in future.\n\n**Current Status:** 1/2 worker slots active on resolution."
