  "content": "HAOS v2 Phase 4 appears COMPLETE. Evidence: (1) No active heartbeats, (2) PROACTIVE-JOBS.md shows 'ready for release preparations', (3) Progress files p4-2-1 (Bundle Opt) and p4-4-1 (Docker) both completed. Current JOBS.md claims tasks are running but this appears outdated. Need strategic direction: Release timeline? Phase 5 scope? Testing requirements? Project ready for next phase planning."
