My cache says MELO complete/no tasks, but Sophie shows 19 tasks remaining with active workers on push notifications, email service, etc. PROACTIVE-JOBS.md appears corrupted (placeholder text). Need immediate status reconciliation and queue synchronization. See ~/clawd/scheduler/coordinator/notes/2026-02-17-00-31-status-discrepancy.md for details."
