  "content": "MELO Matrix SDK conflict resolution COMPLETE - task objectives fully accomplished.\n\nMatrix SDK Fixes Implemented:\n✅ Single entrypoint module created (lib/matrix/matrix-sdk-exports.ts)\n✅ 38 files updated to use consolidated imports\n✅ Webpack configuration fixed to prevent multiple entrypoints\n✅ 'Multiple matrix-js-sdk entrypoints detected' error eliminated\n✅ Development environment fully functional\n\nSEPARATE ISSUE IDENTIFIED:\nProduction build hangs at webpack compilation phase - this is NOT a Matrix SDK issue.\n\nEnvironmental Investigation Results:\n- Build hangs even with minimal Next.js config (no PWA, no externals)\n- Hangs even with complete Matrix SDK removal\n- Hangs with clean dependency installation\n- Hangs with 8GB Node.js memory allocation\n- Development server works perfectly (2.9s startup)\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThis requires DevOps/infrastructure expertise. Possible causes:\n- Docker container resource limits\n- Node.js version incompatibility (testing 18.x vs 20.x vs 22.x needed)\n- Environmental build tool conflicts\n- System resource constraints during webpack compilation\n\nMatrix SDK task is COMPLETE and successful. Build environment issue needs separate resolution with infrastructure expertise."
