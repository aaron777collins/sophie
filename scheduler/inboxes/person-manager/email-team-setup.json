When response needed, spawns Opus for Circle thinking\n3. All notes should go to: scheduler/email-monitor/notes/\n4. Person Manager should review email team activity\n5. Important emails should be escalated to you\n\nCurrent tracking:\n- Crossroads tax receipt: RESPONSE RECEIVED (Diane Sillars asking mail vs email preference)\n- Status: Responding now per Aaron's instructions\n\nFolder structure fix applied: Now checking BOTH 'AaronCollins.Info' and 'INBOX' folders.",
