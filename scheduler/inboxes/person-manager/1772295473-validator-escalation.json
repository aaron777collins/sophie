    "issue": "Catastrophic validation failures indicating systemic quality control breakdown",
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "affected_tasks": ["ST-P2-04-D", "ST-P2-04-C"],
    "pattern": "Tasks reaching validation with 100% unit test success but 92% E2E test failure rates",
    "details": {
      "discovery": "ST-P2-04-D: 19/19 unit tests pass but 12/13 E2E tests fail (92% failure rate)",
      "impact": "Features appear working in unit tests but completely broken in actual UI",
      "scope": "Likely affects multiple recent 'completed' tasks using same methodology",
      "risk": "Could ship completely non-functional features to production"
    },
    "root_causes": [
      "Unit tests over-mocked, providing dangerous false confidence",
      "E2E tests reveal actual integration failures masked by unit test mocks", 
      "Quality gates allowing tasks with integration failures to reach validation",
      "Possible E2E test environment issues (but results suggest real bugs)"
    ],
    "immediate_actions_needed": [
      "STOP all new task assignments until investigation complete",
      "Audit all recent 'self-validated' tasks for similar E2E/unit test disconnects", 
      "Review unit testing methodology - current approach dangerously misleading",
      "Investigate if E2E test environment is broken or finding real integration bugs",
      "Consider E2E-first validation policy before tasks reach self-validated status"
    ],
    "validator_assessment": "This represents the most serious quality control failure I've observed. Unit tests claiming 100% success while 92% of actual functionality fails indicates either broken testing methodology or broken deployment pipeline.",
    "recommendation": "URGENT management intervention required. Current quality processes are fundamentally broken and allowing non-functional code to progress through validation pipeline.",
    "probation_note": "Validation performed correctly per protocol - no false fraud claims, proper directory verification, thorough independent testing caught critical systemic issues."
