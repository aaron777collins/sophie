  "content": {
    "issue": "The unit test fix task (67+ failures) has failed 3 times due to context limits",
    "attempts": [
      {"version": "v1", "time": "13:01 EST", "result": "context limits"},

    "analysis": "Task is too large for single worker context. Workers exceed 200k token limit while analyzing test files and errors.",
    "recommendation": "Break into smaller focused tasks: modal tests, service tests, remaining tests, integration verification",
    "impact": "Conditional passes issued for audit stories - not blocking audit progress but affects validation accuracy",
    "action_requested": "Approve decomposition strategy or provide alternative approach"
