# Coordinator Analysis: JOBS.md vs Reality

**Time:** 2026-02-13 17:00 EST
**Context:** Cron check revealed discrepancy between coordinator JOBS.md and actual state

## Status Discrepancy Identified

### JOBS.md Claims:
- "PHASES 1-4 COMPLETE — Build Working, Need Strategic Direction"
- "No active tasks, awaiting Person Manager guidance"
- "Ready for Phase 5 work or deployment focus"

### PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Reality:
- Shows detailed ongoing tasks across all phases
- Recent completions visible (build-fix-media-exports completed 2026-02-14)
- Progress files show active work continuing

### Progress Files Evidence:
- `p1-layout.md` - Task completed successfully
- `build-fix-media-exports.md` - Recent fix completed 2026-02-14 19:45 EST
- Multiple progress files show ongoing implementation

## Analysis
Appears that JOBS.md became stale while actual work continued. Progress files and PROACTIVE-JOBS show more accurate real-time state.

## Actions Needed
1. Verify current build status (testing in progress: sharp-breeze session)
2. Reconcile JOBS.md with actual state based on progress files
3. Update JOBS.md to reflect true project status

## Next Steps
- Complete build verification
- Update status based on factual evidence from progress files
- Ensure JOBS.md accuracy for future coordination
