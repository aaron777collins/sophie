# Coordinator Status Check - 2026-02-13 19:30 EST

## Current Assessment

### Project Status: MELO-v2
- **Status:** Phases 1-4 Complete, Build Working
- **Position:** Awaiting strategic direction from Person Manager
- **Last Progress:** 2026-02-13 15:01 EST — Build verification confirmed all systems working
- **Current Issue:** No active tasks, project ready for next phase direction

### Task Pipeline
- **Active Workers:** None (no heartbeat files)
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md:** Mostly completed tasks, no pending work
- **Inbox:** Empty (no messages from Person Manager or workers)

### Key Finding
Project reached completion of Phase 4 with working build, but has been in "Need Strategic Direction" state for Phase 5 planning (Voice/Video features) vs deployment focus decision.

### Action Taken
Status verification complete. No cleanup needed (no stale heartbeats).

## Recommendation
Continue monitoring for Person Manager direction on:
1. Phase 5 (Voice/Video) implementation
2. Deployment/production focus
3. New project initiation
