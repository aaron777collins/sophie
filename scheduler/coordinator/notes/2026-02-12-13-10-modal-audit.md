## Summary
- **Phase 2.4:** 4/6 tasks complete
- **Remaining:** Server Settings Modal, User Profile Modal
- **Overall Phase 2:** ~90% complete

## Actions Taken
1. Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md progress table (4/6)
2. Changed server-settings-modal status from "in-progress" to "pending"
3. Noted user-profile-modal needs to be added to tracking

## Recommendation
Phase 2 is very close to completion. Two remaining modals:
1. **Server Settings Modal (p2-4-b)** - Comprehensive settings with tabs
2. **User Profile Modal (p2-4-f)** - User profile card

These could be spawned as the next priority tasks to complete Phase 2.
