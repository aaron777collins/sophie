## Project Review: haos-v2

### Current Status
- **Active project:** haos-v2 Phase 1 - Core Integration
- **Current Phase:** p1-2 (Real-Time Sync Migration)

### Task Progress Analysis

| Task | Status | Issue |
|------|--------|-------|
| p1-2-f | ✅ completed | Done (typing indicators) |
| p1-2-g | ✅ completed | Done (presence hook) |
| p1-2-h | ⚠️ stalled | Read receipts - session has 0 tokens |
| p1-2-i | ⏳ pending | Connection status component |
| p1-2-j | ⏳ pending | Remove Socket.io |

### Issues Identified
1. **Read receipts task stalled** — Session `agent:main:subagent:0b179142-5c02-4289-96c7-f8971691a990` has 0 tokens
   - Started: 2026-02-13 08:55 EST (6+ hours ago)
   - Heartbeat shows "running" but no progress
   - Progress file shows minimal work done

### Actions Required
1. **Restart read receipts task** — Current agent appears stuck
2. **Queue remaining tasks** — Connection status (i) and Socket.io removal (j)
3. **Update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md** to reflect current state

### Slot Count
- Currently using 1 slot (read receipts task, though stalled)
- Can spawn 1 more task once read receipts is resolved
