## Strategic Assessment

### Current Reality Check
PROACTIVE-JOBS.md reflects an ambitious roadmap but actual implementation reveals gaps:
1. **Build was truly broken** — now fixed
2. **Core features need validation** — many listed as "completed" need verification
3. **Phase progression too optimistic** — need realistic restart

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Validate actual app state** — what really works vs. what's claimed
2. **Focus on core messaging** — stop claiming completeness without verification
3. **Restart with realistic scope** — Phase 1-2 foundation work

## Actions Needed
- **No immediate spawns** — need strategic direction from Person Manager
- **Verify current app functionality** — what exists vs. roadmap claims  
- **Reset expectations** — honest assessment of work remaining

## Next Steps
1. Request Person Manager assessment of actual vs. claimed progress
2. Pause new task spawns until realistic baseline established
3. Focus on core messaging functionality validation
