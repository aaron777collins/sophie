# Coordinator Status Check - 2026-02-18 18:31 EST

## Investigation Summary

**Issue:** PROACTIVE-JOBS.md showed Phase 1 as "in-progress" but investigation revealed it was already completed.

## Findings

### Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- **MemberRole enum fixes already committed:** `cd62b49 fix: Use MemberRole enum instead of string literals`
- All 5 files properly converted from string literals to MemberRole enum
- Original task requirements fully met

### New Issue Discovered: Phase 2
- Build now fails with **different** error: Matrix SDK type mismatch in `app/api/channels/route.ts:54:60`
- Error: `Type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'IContent'`
- `sendStateEvent()` method has incorrect parameter ordering
- This issue was exposed after Phase 1 MemberRole fixes

### Active Sessions Working On Issues
Multiple active subagent sessions are working on various aspects:
- `melo-type-system-fixes` (recently spawned)
- `melo-phase1-fix` (confirmed Phase 1 done, reported new issue)
- `melo-phase1-types` (working on type issues)
- `melo-matrix-migration` (broader migration work)

## Actions Taken

1. **Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md** to reflect accurate status:
   - Marked Phase 1 as ✅ complete with commit reference
   - Added new Phase 2 for Matrix SDK type fixes
   - Renumbered subsequent phases accordingly

2. **No cleanup needed** - no stale heartbeats found

3. **Work continues** - active sessions are addressing the current issues

## Current Priority

**Phase 2: Matrix SDK Type Fixes** is now the critical blocker. Active Opus sessions are working on the `app/api/channels/route.ts` type error.

## Next Steps

Monitor active sessions and ensure Phase 2 work progresses. The worker slots are occupied with appropriate Opus agents for this complex type-fixing work.
