# Coordinator Run Notes - 2026-02-15 13:30 EST

## Status Check Results

### ✅ Tasks Recently Completed (Per Sessions)
- **p11-13-mobile-navigation** - Mobile settings navigation fixed (CRITICAL)
- **haos-p8-3-encryption-ui** - Encryption status UI completed  
- **haos-p9-7-emoji-autocomplete** - Emoji autocomplete system implemented
- **haos-p11-1-settings-layout** - Settings layout improvements completed
- **haos-p10-1-role-ui** - Role management UI fully implemented

### 📊 Current System State
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md**: Shows only 2 completed tasks (outdated)
- **Progress files**: Show extensive completed work across phases 8-12
- **Active workers**: 0/2 slots currently occupied
- **Heartbeat files**: None (all workers completed)

### 🔍 Key Finding
**Status Sync Issue**: The PROACTIVE-JOBS.md file appears to be severely out of sync with actual completed work. My jobs file suggests 25/53 tasks complete but not recorded, which aligns with the evidence.

### ⚡ Actions Taken
1. **No new workers spawned** - Unable to identify clear pending tasks that need immediate work
2. **Investigation completed** - Reviewed multiple completed task progress files
3. **Status documented** - All findings recorded for escalation

### 🚨 Escalation Needed
**Person Manager attention required** for:
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md synchronization with actual progress
- Identification of true pending tasks from phases 8-12
- System-wide task tracking reconciliation

### 📈 Progress Evidence
Multiple detailed progress files show extensive completed work in:
- **Phase 8**: Security polish (encryption UI done)
- **Phase 9**: Chat features (emoji autocomplete done) 
- **Phase 10**: Server features (role UI done)
- **Phase 11**: User experience (mobile nav + settings done)

## Next Actions
- Awaiting Person Manager direction on true pending task priorities
- Ready to spawn workers once clear task definitions provided
- System appears healthy but needs task queue reconciliation
