# Coordinator Status Check - 2026-02-16 02:31 EST

## Findings

### Active Work Status
- **1 worker active** (1/2 slots): `p11-6-user-notification-system` 
- Worker is actively progressing, investigating existing notification infrastructure
- Session: `agent:main:subagent:31f09edb-aa9a-440a-b3bc-f13773b94453`

### Stale Status Documentation Issue
The coordinator JOBS.md file contains outdated task status information:

| Task | Listed as | Actual Status |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| p11-1-settings-layout | HIGH priority pending | ✅ COMPLETED (2026-02-15) |
| p9-7-emoji-autocomplete | HIGH priority pending | ✅ COMPLETED (2026-02-15) |
| p8-3-encryption-ui | HIGH priority pending | ✅ COMPLETED (2026-02-15) |
| p11-13-mobile-navigation | Mentioned as critical | ✅ COMPLETED (2026-02-15) |
| p12-1-rate-limiting | Not in active jobs | ✅ COMPLETED (2026-02-15) |

### No Immediate Actions Needed
- Current worker making good progress
- No heartbeats to clean up (directory empty)
- No inbox messages to process
- Many previously critical tasks already completed
- Only 1 genuine pending task currently in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md

### Recommendation
- Monitor current notification system worker progress
- Update coordinator JOBS.md status to reflect reality
- Look for new Phase 11/12 tasks that may need queueing
