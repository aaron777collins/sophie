- ~2-3 remaining tasks (PWA polish, API docs, or integration tests)

## Workers Spawned

1. **p12-6-logging-infrastructure**
   - Session: 940f3eee-704f-4f38-8a90-ce6a6be14512
   - Goal: API logging, request tracking, correlation IDs
   
2. **p12-11-error-reporting-integration**
   - Session: 03d38a8e-4e60-40c2-81c8-652c108f7971
   - Goal: Sentry integration with existing error boundaries

## Autonomous Operations

Successfully operating per IDENTITY.md principles:
- ✅ Verified task completions before acknowledging
- ✅ Maintained queue momentum with immediate respawns
- ✅ Selected next highest-priority infrastructure tasks
- ✅ Updated all tracking files

## Project Status Summary

**MELO v2 is approaching completion:**
- Full feature set implemented across Phases 8-11
- Phase 12 infrastructure is ~75% complete
- Estimated 2-4 tasks remaining to project completion
- All core functionality deployed and working

## Next Steps

1. Monitor current workers (logging + error reporting)
2. When complete, spawn final P12 tasks (likely PWA polish or API documentation)
3. Prepare for project completion milestone report
