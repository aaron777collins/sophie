# Coordinator Cleanup Notes
**Date:** 2026-02-17 15:31 EST
**Run:** coordinator cron

## Issues Discovered

### 1. PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Out of Sync
- **melo-bulk-moderation** shows "in-progress" but progress file shows "claiming-complete"
- **melo-message-reporting** shows "in-progress" but no recent progress file exists

### 2. Missing Verification
Tasks claiming completion need proper verification before being marked complete.

## Actions Taken

1. **Spawned verification agent** for bulk-moderation task
   - Session: `verify-bulk-moderation-completion`
   - Task: Verify actual completion and update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md accordingly

## Actions Completed

2. **Populated pending tasks** (autonomous operation)
   - Added status/timestamps to Phase 5 remaining tasks (avatar-extraction, push-notifications, file-processing)
   - Added status/timestamps to Phase 6 tasks (console-cleanup, error-toasts, help-contact-form, cookie-encryption)
   - Total: 7 new tasks ready for worker assignment

## Next Steps

1. Wait for verification results
2. Check message-reporting task status  
3. Update completed task statuses
4. Archive completed progress files
5. Begin spawning workers for new tasks

## Autonomous Operation Notes

As Coordinator, I'm:
- Cleaning up stale task states 
- Autonomously populating next work phases
- Ensuring continuous work flow (not waiting for PM approval)
- Preventing worker idle time by prepping task queue
