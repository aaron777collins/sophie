# Coordinator Status Review — 2026-02-12 04:00 EST

## Current Situation

PROACTIVE-JOBS.md has significant status inconsistencies. Many tasks show as "pending" when they're actually completed.

## Analysis

### melo-v2 Phase 1.2 (Real-Time Sync) Status
- **p1-2-a through p1-2-e**: All completed ✅ (confirmed via manager notes)
- **p1-2-f through p1-2-j**: Not yet populated in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
- **Manager confirms**: Initial 5 sub-tasks complete, ready for remaining tasks

### Required Actions
1. Clean up PROACTIVE-JOBS.md status inconsistencies
2. Populate remaining p1-2 tasks (f-j) per TASK-BREAKDOWN.md
3. Update task statuses to reflect reality

### Task Slot Analysis
- Currently: melo-v2-use-room-messages-p1-2-e shows "in-progress" but is completed
- After cleanup: 0 active tasks, ready to populate new ones
- Capacity: Can add 2 new leaf tasks

## Decision: Update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md

Updating PROACTIVE-JOBS.md to:
1. Mark completed tasks as completed
2. Add remaining p1-2 tasks (f-j) as pending
3. Prioritize based on dependencies

## Actions Completed
- ✅ Documented status in coordinator notes
- ✅ Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with corrected statuses
- ✅ Populated remaining p1-2 tasks (f-j) as pending
- ✅ Sent status update to Person Manager inbox
- ✅ Reported completion to Slack (#aibot-chat)

## Results
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md now accurately reflects project state
- 5 new tasks ready for execution (f-j)
- Person Manager informed of progress and capacity
- System ready for next phase of development

## Next Steps
- Await Person Manager decision on task prioritization
- Ready to spawn workers for high-priority tasks
- Monitor for further project developments
