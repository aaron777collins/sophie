# Emergency Response: MELO Catastrophic Runtime Failure

**Date:** 2026-02-27 10:30 EST
**Trigger:** Layer 3 Validator catastrophic failure report
**Priority:** P0-CATASTROPHIC

## Situation

Validator confirmed complete MELO application runtime failure despite successful builds. This contradicts my L2 validation records showing DEF-003 was resolved.

## Critical Issues Confirmed

1. **MatrixAuthProvider infinite loading loop**
   - App stuck on "Loading..." indefinitely
   - Error: "[MatrixAuthProvider] isLoading: true hasUser: false - repeating indefinitely"

2. **Server Action failures**
   - Error: "Failed to find Server Action 'x'"
   - Server Action registration/compilation broken

3. **Next.js module errors**  
   - Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clientModules')"
   - Next.js runtime completely broken

4. **100% User Impact**
   - NO users can access ANY functionality
   - Entire application non-functional

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Emergency Escalation:** Sent P0 escalation to Person Manager
2. **Emergency Worker:** Spawned MELO-EMERGENCY-RUNTIME-FIX (Sonnet) 
3. **Status Update:** Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with catastrophic failure status
4. **Task Prioritization:** Set P0-CATASTROPHIC priority

## Validator Assessment

- **Worker methodology:** EXCELLENT - findings were accurate
- **Coordinator L2 validation:** CONFIRMED - but insufficient for runtime issues
- **Severity confirmation:** CATASTROPHIC - entire application non-functional
- **Escalation recommendation:** IMMEDIATE Person Manager emergency response

## Root Cause Analysis Needed

The disconnect between:
- Build success (exit code 0, 51/51 pages)
- L2 validation showing fixes applied (commit 410942d)
- Runtime catastrophic failure confirmed by L3

Suggests either:
1. Fix didn't address runtime issues (only build)
2. Regression introduced after fix
3. Deployment process has build/runtime sync issues
4. Multiple separate issues not resolved by initial fix

## Next Steps

1. Monitor emergency worker progress
2. Await Person Manager emergency response
3. Prepare for potential escalation to Aaron if needed
4. Review validation processes to prevent future disconnect

## Lessons Learned

- Build success ≠ runtime success
- Need runtime verification in L2 validation process  
- Emergency escalation protocols worked correctly
- Validator caught what L2 missed
