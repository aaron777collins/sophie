# Task Spawning Session

**Date:** 2026-02-25 09:00 EST
**Coordinator:** Autonomous execution

## Tasks Spawned

### 1. melo-matrix-1-fix (Sonnet)
- **Reason:** Layer 3 validation failure - critical issues need fixing
- **Session:** agent:main:subagent:57f3b0f9-7304-4645-9bf4-f778d82c9e0b
- **Priority:** HIGH (fixing failed validation)
- **Issues to Address:**
  - Test failures (6 failed, 48 passed)  
  - Dev2 deployment connectivity
  - File path verification
  - Browser functionality validation

### 2. melo-test-infra-1 (Sonnet) 
- **Reason:** Pending task - keeping work flowing autonomously
- **Session:** agent:main:subagent:9a4cd529-1727-4632-a72b-00db5edfa308
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (infrastructure stability)
- **Focus:** Chat-input test failures and test infrastructure fixes

## Worker Slot Status
- **Current utilization:** 2/2 (at formal warning limit)
- **Both slots:** Sonnet model (complex tasks requiring reasoning)

## Autonomous Execution Note
Following coordinator identity guidance: "Keep 2 worker slots occupied at all times if work exists"
- Did not wait for Person Manager approval  
- Selected highest priority pending work
- Validation failure fix takes precedence

## Next Actions
1. Monitor both tasks for completion
2. Perform thorough Layer 2 validation (especially melo-matrix-1-fix)
3. Process validation requests to Validator
4. Continue autonomous work flow management

**Status:** Both workers active, system progressing efficiently
