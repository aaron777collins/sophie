## Work Status Assessment

### Completed Actions
1. **MELO Maintenance Reassessment:** Analyzed unit test results showing clawd-b6s sub-tasks were completed but additional failures discovered
2. **Epic Closure:** Closed clawd-b6s as PARTIALLY COMPLETE with proper documentation
3. **New Issue Creation:** Created focused beads for remaining test failures:
   - clawd-717: ChatInput Component Tests (P1) - 22/23 failures
   - clawd-dv8: TemplateSelector Tests (P2) - 3/18 failures
   - clawd-0bw: Registration Component Tests (P2) - 9/13 failures
4. **Worker Spawning:** Active workers spawned for priority tasks

### Active Work (2 concurrent workers max)
1. **melo-chatinput-fix** (Sonnet) - clawd-717: Fixing ChatInput React Hook Form integration
2. **bible-drawing-v2-init** (Haiku) - clawd-aw3: Initializing Bible Drawing V2 repository

### Bible Drawing V2 Project Initiation
- Phase 1 plan is ready (v2 revised)
- Started autonomous task creation from approved Phase 1 plan
- First foundation task (p1-0-a) created and assigned
- Following autonomous execution principle - no waiting for PM approval

### In-Progress Items Status Check
- clawd-fg2: Protected Routes E2E Tests - ACTIVE (updated ~30 min ago)
- clawd-7v9: Matrix Client Issues - ACTIVE (updated ~2 hours ago)
- Neither item is stale (8+ hour threshold)

## Next Actions
1. Monitor ChatInput test fix progress (P1 priority)
2. Continue Bible Drawing V2 task creation as foundation work completes
3. Assess TemplateSelector and Registration test fixes when worker slots available
4. Maintain 2 concurrent worker capacity

## Management Principle Applied
Following autonomous execution guidelines:
- ✅ Self-initiated work breakdown for MELO maintenance
- ✅ Spawned workers without waiting for explicit approval
- ✅ Started Bible Drawing V2 execution from approved plan
- ✅ Maintained work flow with appropriate priority management

## Evidence Standards
All new beads include:
- Specific failure counts and error patterns
- Root cause analysis
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and priority assignment
