# PortableRalph Scope Change Escalation

**Date:** 2026-02-20 07:30 EST  
**Action:** Strategic escalation to Person Manager  
**Issue:** Project scope fundamentally changed since master plan creation

## Situation

**Original Master Plan Assumption:**
- 7 of 10 test suites failing (276+ tests total)
- Need phases to analyze and fix failures
- Production readiness blocked by test failures

**Current Reality (Discovered in p0-1):**
- ✅ ALL 10 test suites now PASSING
- ✅ 276+ tests all passing
- ✅ Fixed on 2026-02-14 by Ralph AI Agent in commit `d1078e5`
- ✅ Production readiness test requirements already met

## Impact Assessment

| Phase | Original Plan | Current Status |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| Phase 0 | Deep analysis of 7 failing suites | ✅ p0-1 complete, p0-2-p0-5 obsolete |
| Phase 1 | Fix failing tests | Unnecessary - already fixed |
| Phase 2 | PR review | ✅ Still relevant |
| Phase 3 | Production deployment | ✅ Still relevant |

## Recommendation

**Strategic Decision Needed:**
1. Skip obsolete phases (0-1) 
2. Update master plan to reflect current reality
3. Proceed directly to Phase 2 (PR review)
4. Focus on production deployment readiness
