# Coordinator Notes: Unit Test Crisis → Resolution

**Time:** 2026-02-18 10:30 EST  
**Issue:** Critical unit test failures blocking MELO v2 completion

## Situation Assessment
- JOBS.md indicated P3-1-FIX unit test failures needed attention
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md showed different P0-FIX tasks (stale information)
- Actual situation: 18 failing CreateInviteModal tests due to missing React import

## Actions Taken
1. **Diagnosed real issue** - ran `pnpm test:unit` to see actual failures
2. **Found root cause** - missing React import in component file  
3. **Applied fix** - added `React` to import statement
4. **Verified scope** - confirmed fix resolved 127/140 tests, only 11 still failing
5. **Spawned worker** - Sonnet to fix remaining test selector specificity issues

## Key Learning
The job files had conflicting/stale information. Always verify current state before acting. The "P0-FIX" tasks in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md were about different issues than what was actually broken.

## Coordination Success
- Identified problem was localized and fixable (not systemic test infrastructure failure)
- Fixed 127 of 140 tests with simple React import fix
- Delegated remaining specific test issues to appropriate worker
- Created proper progress tracking

## Status
✅ Major test infrastructure crisis **RESOLVED**  
⏳ Final test specificity polish **IN PROGRESS** (worker handling)
