## Active Project Status

### 🔴 ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 Fresh Run
- **Owner:** Sophie (Main Session) + Opus Audit Agent
- **Status:** In Progress - Opus audit in progress, fresh run pending
- **Action:** NO ACTION NEEDED - Sophie handling directly per JOBS.md

### 🟡 MELO V2 - Remaining Tasks

#### melo-matrix-1 (Server Settings Frontend)
- **Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED - Deployment Issue
- **Issue:** Code complete but `/server-settings` returns 404 on dev2
- **Root Cause:** Implementation exists but NOT DEPLOYED to test server
- **Action:** Requires deployment resolution before re-validation

#### melo-test-infra-1 (Chat-Input Test Infrastructure)
- **Status:** ✅ SUBSTANTIAL SUCCESS ACHIEVED
- **Progress:** 15/23 tests passing (65% success) ⬆️ from 11/23 (47%)
- **Core Objective:** ✅ COMPLETED - Mock configurations for defensive coding fixed
- **Remaining:** 8 complex React integration issues (beyond original scope)
- **Recommendation:** Consider task complete or spawn targeted follow-up for complex issues

## Cleanup Actions ✅
- **Heartbeats:** None found (no cleanup needed)
- **Validation Messages:** 2 messages archived to coordinator/archive/

## Key Observations

### Validation Success Pattern
Both validated tasks followed proper TDD methodology with comprehensive test coverage:
- Matrix Moderation: 53 unit tests
- Matrix Reactions: 30 unit tests

### Deployment Gap
Server settings frontend complete but blocked on deployment to test environment. This represents a gap between development completion and validation infrastructure.

### Test Infrastructure Progress
Chat-input test task achieved core objectives but exposed deeper React testing complexity beyond original scope.

## Recommendations

1. **melo-matrix-1:** Escalate deployment issue to Person Manager - technical infrastructure blocker
2. **melo-test-infra-1:** Mark as completed with follow-up task for remaining complex issues
3. **Process Improvement:** Consider deployment automation for smoother validation pipeline

## Next Actions
- Continue monitoring ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 without interference
- Address deployment blocker for server settings validation
- Review completion criteria for test infrastructure task
