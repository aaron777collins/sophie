# Coordinator Assessment — 2026-02-16 06:00 EST

## Status Review

### Current Situation
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md**: Only shows 1 completed task (p11-6-user-notification-system)
- **Progress Files**: Show extensive work completed but not properly marked
- **Coordinator Jobs**: Claims 25/56 tasks complete, 31 pending
- **Reality**: Tasks completed but status not properly updated

### Key Findings

1. **Status Mismatch**: Progress files show work completed but PROACTIVE-JOBS.md not updated
   - `melo-p11-13-mobile-navigation.md` - shows completed work but marked "in-progress"
   - `melo-p11-1-settings-layout.md` - shows full completion but not updated

2. **Missing Task Population**: PROACTIVE-JOBS.md needs to be repopulated with remaining 31 tasks

3. **Worker Status**: 0/2 slots occupied, no active workers running

## Action Items

1. **Immediate**: Review and update completed task statuses
2. **Next**: Populate PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with remaining pending tasks from phases 8-12
3. **Then**: Spawn workers for high-priority pending tasks

## Priority Tasks (from Coordinator Jobs)
- p11-13-mobile-navigation (CRITICAL — Mobile audit findings)
- p11-1-settings-layout (HIGH — Settings UX) 
- p9-7-emoji-autocomplete (HIGH — Chat completion)
- p8-3-encryption-ui (HIGH — Security polish)

## Notes
- MELO Master Plan shows comprehensive 6-phase implementation
- Current focus: Phases 8-12 (Security Polish, Chat Features, Server Features, User Experience, Infrastructure)
- Need to verify actual completion status vs. reported status
