# Coordinator Cleanup — 2026-02-15 06:01 EST

## Issue Found
PROACTIVE-JOBS.md had stale "in-progress" status for p9-1-message-editing and p9-2-message-deletion, but:
- No workers active in sessions list
- No progress files exist for these tasks  
- No heartbeat files exist
- No recent git commits for these features

## Action Taken
1. **Reset Task Status:** Changed p9-1 and p9-2 from "in-progress" → "pending"
2. **Updated Progress:** Corrected Phase 9 from "3/8 complete" → "1/8 complete" (only p9-4 mentions actually finished)
3. **Updated Phase 10:** Corrected to "5/14 complete" — added p10-6-user-kick and p10-7-user-ban completions
4. **Cleared Worker Slots:** Updated slot management from "2/2 ACTIVE" → "0/2 AVAILABLE"

## Current Priority Status
**High Priority Tasks (🟠 HIGH):**
- p9-1-message-editing (pending) — Critical chat feature
- p9-2-message-deletion (pending) — Critical chat feature  
- p10-3-permission-assignment (pending) — Depends on p10-2 ✅

**Recently Completed:**
- p10-6-user-kick ✅ (2026-02-27 12:50 EST)
- p10-7-user-ban ✅ (2026-02-15 05:43 EST)

## Next Actions
Spawn 2 workers to fill available slots:
1. p9-1-message-editing (Sonnet) — Message editing UI
2. p9-2-message-deletion (Sonnet) — Message deletion UI

These are fundamental chat features needed for Phase 9 completion.

## System Health
- ✅ No stale heartbeat files
- ✅ Recent completions properly documented (p10-6, p10-7)
- ✅ PROACTIVE-JOBS.md now accurate
- ✅ Ready to resume work on chat features
