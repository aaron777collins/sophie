**Action:** Spawned worker for critical blocker task  
**Session:** agent:main:subagent:74fea06b-24c7-41b8-8a10-275a9ea7e1e5

## Context
- Single ACTIVE task in jobs file: P3-1-FIX (unit test failures)
- Status: BLOCKER for final project completion
- Previous work: ReactionHandler import issue fixed, 8 failing tests → 3 failing tests
- No workers currently running (empty heartbeats directory)

## Action Taken
Spawned Sonnet worker to complete remaining unit test fixes:
- Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
- Task: Fix 3 remaining failing unit tests in message-reactions.test.tsx
- Expected completion: 1-2 hours
- Worker has full completion checklist including PROACTIVE-JOBS.md update

## Expected Outcome
- 100% unit test pass rate achieved
- P3-1-FIX marked completed in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
- Heartbeat file cleaned up
- Project unblocked for final completion

## Next Steps
- Monitor worker progress via heartbeat files
- Verify completion actions are performed correctly
- Ready to proceed with any remaining phases once blocker resolved
