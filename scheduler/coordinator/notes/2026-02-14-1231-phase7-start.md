# Coordinator Action: Phase 7 Launch - 2026-02-14 12:31 EST

## Context
- Phase 6 complete: All 9 tasks finished (2026-02-15 05:46 EST)
- Phase 7 ready to start: 10 CRITICAL security + voice/video tasks
- Aaron's direct order: Fix MELO E2EE security vulnerabilities

## Critical Issues Identified
**🔴 SECURITY EMERGENCY:** MELO currently has **ZERO E2EE** - messages are plaintext on server
- This violates basic security expectations for a Discord-like platform
- Phase 7 specifically addresses this with Element-level encryption

## Actions Taken (12:31 EST)

### 1. Spawned p7-1-crypto-init (CRITICAL - Opus)
- **Agent:** agent:main:subagent:2281ad27-f687-4525-ac14-9b5d2159bd3d
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Foundation for all E2EE work
- **Why First:** Blocks p7-2 through p7-6 (all security tasks)
- **Scope:** Initialize @matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm, IndexedDB store, client integration

### 2. Spawned p7-7-livekit-deploy (Infrastructure - Sonnet)
- **Agent:** agent:main:subagent:7bec27ae-387e-433a-9e90-9f61c169f592
- **Priority:** HIGH - Voice/video infrastructure
- **Why Parallel:** Independent of security work, can run concurrently
- **Scope:** Docker deployment, Caddy config, API setup, connectivity testing

## Task Flow Strategy
**Security Chain (Sequential):**
1. p7-1-crypto-init → p7-2-room-encryption → p7-3-device-verify → p7-4-cross-signing → p7-5-key-backup → p7-6-secret-storage

**Voice/Video Chain (Parallel):**
1. p7-7-livekit-deploy → p7-8-voice-channels → p7-9-video-calls → p7-10-screen-share

## Next Steps
- Monitor crypto-init completion (blocks 5 other security tasks)
- Monitor livekit-deploy completion (blocks 3 voice/video tasks)
- Ready to spawn p7-2-room-encryption as soon as p7-1 completes
- Ready to spawn p7-8-voice-channels as soon as p7-7 completes

## Status Update
- **In Progress:** 2 tasks (p7-1, p7-7)
- **Pending:** 8 tasks awaiting dependencies
- **Estimated Timeline:** 6-8 hours for full Phase 7 completion
- **Risk:** Crypto initialization is complex - may need debugging

## Communication
- Both agents have full completion checklists
- Will auto-update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md when complete
- Slack notifications configured for progress tracking
