## Summary
MELO v2 project at **strategic decision point**. Phases 1-4 complete, build working, awaiting direction on Phase 5 (Voice/Video) vs deployment focus.

## Status Verification Results
- ✅ **Build Working:** npm run build completes successfully 
- ✅ **Phases 1-4 Complete:** Core chat UI, Matrix integration, real-time messaging, UX features
- ✅ **No Active Blockers:** Previous build issues resolved days ago
- ✅ **No Active Workers:** All execution complete, heartbeats clean

## Current State Analysis
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md:** Shows completed tasks through Phase 4
- **Progress Files:** All major components implemented and verified
- **Build System:** Functional, no TypeScript errors, all routes exporting
- **Docker:** Deployment-ready container available

## Strategic Decision Needed
**Question for Person Manager:** Given Phase 1-4 completion:
1. **Phase 5 Priority:** Start Voice/Video implementation?
2. **Deployment Focus:** Polish and production deployment?
3. **New Features:** Additional functionality beyond current scope?

## Recommendation
- No immediate task spawning needed
- Await Person Manager strategic direction
- Ready to execute whatever next phase is chosen
- Project in excellent state for either Voice/Video or deployment path

## Next Actions
- Continue monitoring (no active tasks to manage)
- Respond to Person Manager guidance when received
- Ready to populate PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with Phase 5 tasks or deployment work
