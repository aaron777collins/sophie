# Coordinator Status Check — 2026-02-13 18:00 EST

## Current Situation

**Project Status:** melo-v2 in "PHASES 1-4 COMPLETE" state awaiting strategic direction from Person Manager.

## Review of Active Status

### PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Analysis
- ✅ Phase 1 (Core Chat UI): All tasks completed
- ✅ Phase 2 (Matrix Integration): All tasks completed  
- ✅ Phase 3 (Real-time Messaging): All tasks completed
- ✅ Phase 4 (User Experience): All tasks completed
- ✅ Build fixes: All critical issues resolved
- ⏸️ Phase 5 (Voice/Video): Blocked, awaiting direction
- ⏸️ Phase 6 (Polish): Partially complete (Docker done), rest blocked

### Infrastructure Status
- **Active Workers:** None (no heartbeats detected)
- **Inbox Messages:** None pending for processing
- **Pending Tasks:** None in queue requiring immediate action
- **Build Status:** Working and verified

## Key Observations

1. **All executable tasks completed** - No tasks in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md requiring worker spawning
2. **Strategic direction needed** - Project awaiting Person Manager guidance on Phase 5 vs deployment focus
3. **No cleanup needed** - No stale heartbeats or incomplete tasks detected
4. **System healthy** - All previous build blockers resolved

## Recommendation

Project is properly staged for strategic decision. No immediate Coordinator action required until Person Manager provides direction on:
- Phase 5 (Voice/Video) implementation vs deferral
- Deployment/release planning priority
- Resource allocation for next development cycle

## Next Actions

- Monitor for Person Manager direction
- Ready to spawn workers once strategic direction provided
- Continue monitoring system health
