# Coordinator Notes — Phase 7 Task Respawn

**Date:** 2026-02-15 13:00 EST  
**Session:** coordinator (Level 2)

## Situation Found
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md showed p7-4-cross-signing and p7-9-video-calls as "in-progress"
- No heartbeats found in ~/clawd/scheduler/heartbeats/
- No progress files for these tasks
- **Diagnosis:** Tasks had stalled or agents completed without updating status

## Dependencies Analysis
✅ **p7-4-cross-signing** ready:
- Depends on: p7-3-device-verify (✅ completed)
- No blockers found

✅ **p7-9-video-calls** ready:
- Depends on: p7-8-voice-channels (✅ completed)  
- LiveKit infrastructure already deployed

## Actions Taken
1. **Spawned p7-4-cross-signing:**
   - Agent: agent:main:subagent:3cdbc1a2-8836-49ce-ae46-72d2ea5bb859
   - Model: Sonnet
   - Task: Implement cross-signing setup (E2EE security)

2. **Spawned p7-9-video-calls:**
   - Agent: agent:main:subagent:8fe2892b-0cc0-4d4c-8b3b-7047a4bdcb17
   - Model: Sonnet
   - Task: Complete video call functionality with LiveKit

3. **Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md:**
   - Updated agent IDs and start times
   - Corrected task summary counts: 5 ✅, 2 🔄, 3 ⏳
   - Both tasks can run in parallel (no dependencies on each other)

## Next Tasks Ready When These Complete
- **p7-5-key-backup** — After p7-4-cross-signing completes
- **p7-10-screen-share** — After p7-9-video-calls completes
- **p7-6-secret-storage** — After p7-5-key-backup completes

## Phase 7 Progress
**Security Track:** 3/6 complete (crypto-init ✅, room-encryption ✅, device-verify ✅, cross-signing 🔄)
**Voice/Video Track:** 3/4 complete (livekit-deploy ✅, voice-channels ✅, video-calls 🔄, screen-share ⏳)

**Critical:** Once p7-2-room-encryption validates with live testing, MELO will have full E2EE security.
