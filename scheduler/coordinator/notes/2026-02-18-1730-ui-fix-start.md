# UI Fix Startup - 2026-02-18 17:30 EST

## Situation
Received emergency directive from Aaron about melo UI being built incorrectly. All previous work was halted because:
- UI was built from scratch instead of copying discord-clone reference
- Haiku was assigned UI work (cannot judge visual design)
- No visual verification was performed with Playwright
- Hours wasted on bad output

## Actions Taken

### 1. Spawned Critical Worker
- **Task:** MELO-UI-FIX-P1 (Discord Clone Reference Setup)
- **Model:** Opus (required for visual planning)
- **Session:** `agent:main:subagent:11c4bcd2-5fa4-42fd-bde8-f530e99d9d79`
- **Started:** 17:30 EST

### 2. Updated Tracking
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md: pending → in-progress
- Created heartbeat: `scheduler/heartbeats/MELO-UI-FIX-P1.json`

### 3. Worker Mission
Phase 1 setup work:
1. Clone nayak-nirmalya/discord-clone to /tmp/discord-clone-ref
2. Take reference screenshots
3. Create component mapping document
4. Extract design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)

## Next Steps
Worker will:
1. Complete Phase 1 setup
2. Update progress and memory files
3. Set status to `needs-validation`
4. I will then self-validate and send to Validator

## Critical Learning
Never assign UI work to Haiku. Always use visual verification for UI changes. Copy existing designs exactly rather than creating from scratch.

## Priority
🔴 CRITICAL - Aaron is upset about wasted time. Must redeem ourselves with perfect execution.
