# Coordinator Status Check - 2026-02-15 22:30 EST

## Current State Analysis

### Inbox Status
- No messages from Person Manager or Workers
- No pending communications to process

### Active Project: HAOS Full Implementation
- **Current Status:** Recovery mode with significant progress made
- **Key Finding:** All 4 priority tasks in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md are now COMPLETED:
  - p10-7-channel-permissions ✅ (Channel permission overrides)  
  - p10-9-role-assignment ✅ (Bulk role assignment tools)
  - p12-13-security-headers ✅ (Production security headers)
  - p12-1-rate-limiting ✅ (API rate limiting)

### Progress Files Review
- Recent completions show quality implementation with comprehensive features
- Build issues resolved in most recent tasks
- Security infrastructure (Phase 12) making good progress
- Server features (Phase 10) advancing well

### Worker Status
- **Current Slots:** 0/2 occupied (all workers completed their tasks)
- **Previous Issues:** Session spawn problems mentioned in jobs file, but work continued via alternative methods
- **Result:** Tasks completed successfully despite spawn issues

## Actions Taken
- Reviewed all current task statuses in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
- Analyzed progress files for recent completions
- Verified no stale heartbeats requiring cleanup
- Confirmed no pending work items in queue

## Next Steps Needed
1. **Update project status** - The "critical recovery" status may be outdated given recent completions
2. **Assess remaining phases** - Phase 11 (User Experience) and remaining Phase 12 tasks need evaluation
3. **Report completion** to Person Manager for next phase planning

## Model Performance Notes
- Workers using claude-sonnet-4-20250514 successfully completing complex tasks
- Quality implementations with proper validation and documentation
- Build issues resolved efficiently

## Recommendations
- Consider updating HAOS project status from "critical recovery" to "active progress"
- Evaluate readiness for next batch of tasks from remaining phases
- Continue with current model assignments (working well)
