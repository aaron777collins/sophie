## Current MELO Status

### Completed P0 Tasks ✅
- **P0-1**: Admin Invites UI Page (completed 2026-02-17 18:20)

### Active Workers 🔄
- **P0-3-login-integration**: Wiring invite check into login flow (started 18:31)
- **P0-4-signup-invite-input**: Adding invite input to sign-up page (started 18:32)

### Remaining P0 Tasks ⏳
- **P0-6**: Fix 8 failing E2E tests (pending)

## Task Queue Cleanup

Found inconsistencies in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md:
- P0-3 showed as "completed 2026-02-18" but was actually pending
- Updated completed tasks to reflect accurate status
- Spawned workers for P0-3 and P0-4 to utilize both available slots

## Next Actions

Once current workers complete:
1. Spawn worker for P0-6 (E2E test fixes)
2. Begin P1 tasks after all P0 blockers resolved
3. Prepare for MELO production deployment

## Worker Utilization

| Slot | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | P0-3-login-integration | 🔄 Active |
| 2 | P0-4-signup-invite-input | 🔄 Active |

Both workers have clear instructions and completion checklists.
