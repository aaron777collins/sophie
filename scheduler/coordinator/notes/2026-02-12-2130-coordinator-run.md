## Situation Assessment

### Inbox Status
- **Messages:** 0 (empty directory)
- **Actions:** No messages to process

### Active Projects  
- **haos-v2:** Phase 4 (Production Ready) - ACTIVE
- **Status:** 2 major tasks just completed
- **Timeline:** Target completion 2026-03-08

### Recent Task Completions (Just Observed)
1. **haos-v2-self-host-guide-p4-1-3** ✅ COMPLETED (~23 min ago)
   - Comprehensive Docker self-hosting guide (52KB documentation)
   - Self-host deployment instructions, SSL/TLS, monitoring, backup procedures
   - Session: `agent:main:subagent:bfdf5773-c8e3-4cee-be85-198d69bbd19d`

2. **haos-v2-e2e-tests-p4-3-1** ✅ COMPLETED (~25 min ago)  
   - End-to-end testing suite with Cypress framework
   - 100% critical path coverage, performance monitoring, CI/CD integration
   - Session: `agent:main:subagent:7c97f383-1e02-48a9-b032-611ff6c2fdbb`

### System Observations
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md:** Only shows p4-1-3 as completed, missing other Phase 4 tasks
- **Active Sessions:** 3 active subagents, 2 just completed work
- **Heartbeats:** No active heartbeat files
- **Progress Files:** Multiple exist but need systematic review

## Analysis

### Phase 4 Progress
Based on observed completions and daily memory:
- **p4-1-3 (Self-Host Guide):** ✅ COMPLETED 
- **p4-3-1 (E2E Tests):** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Additional tasks:** Likely in progress but not properly tracked in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md

### Task Tracking Issue
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md appears to be minimally maintained
- Active work happening through other coordination mechanisms
- Need to sync actual progress with formal task tracking

## Actions Taken
1. **Status Investigation:** Reviewed active sessions, recent completions
2. **Documentation:** Captured current state in coordinator notes
3. **Prepared Report:** Ready to report Phase 4 progress to Person Manager

## Next Steps
1. **Sync PROACTIVE-JOBS.md:** Update with actual Phase 4 task status
2. **Check remaining Phase 4 work:** Identify pending tasks
3. **Continue execution:** Spawn next Phase 4 tasks if slots available
4. **Report progress:** Update Person Manager on Phase 4 advancement

## Current State Summary
- **Slot Usage:** Currently 1-2 active (within limits)
- **Phase 4 Status:** Significant progress made (self-hosting + testing complete)
- **System Health:** Workers completing successfully, proper cleanup observed
- **Coordination:** Need better sync between PROACTIVE-JOBS.md and actual work

**Result:** Phase 4 advancing well with major components completed. Task tracking needs coordination improvement.
