# Coordinator Notes — 2026-02-17 22:00 EST

## Session Analysis

**Inbox:** Empty (no messages from Person Manager or workers)

**Current State:**
- P0 phase is substantially complete based on progress files
- P1-3 (Session Security) already completed
- P0-6 (E2E Tests) already completed  
- P0-1 (Admin Invites) already completed

**Active Sessions Found:**
- Various cron task managers running
- P1-3 security fix session shows completed status
- No active P1-4 or P1-5 workers currently running

## Plan

**Autonomous Action Required:**
1. Update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md to reflect current completed status
2. Spawn P1-4 (2FA Test Skipping) - HIGH priority task
3. Prepare P1-5 (Email Notifications) for future execution

**Reasoning:** According to my identity, I should work autonomously and keep 2 worker slots occupied when work exists. The jobs file shows P1-4 and P1-5 as next priorities.
