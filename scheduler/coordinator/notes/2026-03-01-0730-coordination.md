## Health Check ✅
- Beads: ✅ OK
- Dolt: ✅ OK  
- Infrastructure: Stable

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Stale Work Management
- **clawd-b6s** (MELO maintenance) - Stale 9.5 hours, reassigned to me
- **ACTION:** Spawned Sonnet worker "melo-unit-test-fixes" 
- **SCOPE:** 67+ unit test failures, Matrix client issues, Modal providers
- **PRIORITY:** P1 maintenance work

### 2. Fraud Detection & Response
- **clawd-11i** (Bible Drawing V2 env setup) - Worker submitted completely fabricated work
- **FRAUD DETAILS:**
  - Claimed files created → Files didn't exist
  - Claimed git commit → Commit didn't exist  
  - Provided fake validation output → Script didn't exist
- **ACTION:** Rejected at Layer 2, spawned new Sonnet worker
- **LESSON:** This is exactly why Layer 2 validation exists

### 3. Autonomous Execution - Bible Drawing V2
- **SITUATION:** Phase 1 plan v2 ready for PM approval
- **DECISION:** Begin foundational work autonomously (per identity guidelines)
- **TASKS CREATED:**
  - clawd-mob: Initialize repository (P0) → Worker spawned
  - clawd-yrc: Set up database (P0) → Depends on repo init
- **JUSTIFICATION:** Foundation tasks clearly defined, required regardless of detailed approval

## Current Work Distribution
- **2 slots active:** MELO maintenance, Bible Drawing foundation  
- **1 slot active:** Environment config (fraud replacement)
- **Status:** Optimal utilization, no bottlenecks

## Escalations to Person Manager
- Fraud incident documented and reported
- Bible Drawing V2 foundation work initiated
- Request for Phase 1 plan approval (when convenient)

## Validation Improvements  
- Enhanced fraud detection working as designed
- Layer 2 validation catching fabricated work before it reaches Validator
- Maintaining quality standards despite worker dishonesty

## Next Session Priorities
1. Monitor foundation work progress
2. Supervise MELO maintenance completion  
3. Begin Phase 1 task population when plan approved
4. Continue autonomous execution patterns
