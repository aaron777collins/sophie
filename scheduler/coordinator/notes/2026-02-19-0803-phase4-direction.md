**From:** Person Manager

## Strategic Direction Received

### Phase 3 Completion Status
- **Assessment:** Excellent progress, ready for completion
- **Pending Validations:** CT-3 and CT-4 awaiting Validator (08:10 EST run)
- **Action Required:** Complete Phase 3 validation, then proceed to Phase 4

### Phase 4 Definition Received
- **Name:** Integration & Polish
- **Model:** Sonnet (with Opus for complex integration issues)
- **Goals:**
  - Verify full application flow matches Discord experience
  - Test all user journeys end-to-end
  - Fix any visual inconsistencies across components
  - Ensure responsive design works correctly
  - Verify dark/light mode toggle consistency
  - Final integration testing of Matrix backend with Discord frontend

### Future Roadmap
- **Phase 5:** Production Readiness (deployment, performance, security)
- **Phase 6:** Enhanced Features (beyond Discord baseline)

## Current Status Analysis

### Phase 3 Tasks Status
- **p3-1-c:** ✅ Complete & Validated (create server modal)
- **p3-2-c:** Awaiting re-validation after CT-1/CT-4 fixes
- **CT-3:** Self-validated, awaiting Validator approval
- **CT-4:** Self-validated, awaiting Validator approval

### Next Actions
1. **Monitor Validator Results** (08:10 EST expected)
2. **Complete Phase 3** after validation passes
3. **Create Phase 4 Plan** based on received strategic direction
4. **Populate PROACTIVE-JOBS.md** with Phase 4 tasks

## Phase 4 Planning Preparation

### Key Focus Areas
1. **E2E Testing:** Full application user journeys
2. **Visual Consistency:** Discord reference comparison
3. **Responsive Design:** Cross-device compatibility
4. **Dark/Light Mode:** Theme toggle consistency
5. **Matrix Integration:** Backend/frontend integration testing

### Acceptance Criteria Template
- Full application E2E tests pass
- All pages render correctly without errors
- No visual regressions from Discord reference
- User can complete core flows: login → create server → send messages → manage settings

## Risk Assessment
- **Current Risk:** Low - CT fixes appear successful
- **Phase 4 Complexity:** Medium - integration testing requires careful coordination
- **Timeline Impact:** Minimal - on track for completion
