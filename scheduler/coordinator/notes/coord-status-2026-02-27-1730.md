## Actions Taken

### ✅ Completed
1. **Security Protocol Review** - Read and internalized external action protocol
2. **Job Assessment** - Reviewed MELO V2 audit status and identified active needs
3. **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Population** - Updated with current priority tasks
4. **L2 Validation Spawn** - Spawned Sonnet agent for S11 DM audit Layer 2 validation
   - Session: agent:main:subagent:e5838cfe-8581-4d93-9b59-648767e9141a
   - Task: Validate corrected S11 evidence after fabrication incident

### 📊 Current Project Status

#### MELO V2 Comprehensive Audit - Phase 1
- **Emergency Resolution:** ✅ COMPLETE - Application fully restored
- **Active Tasks:** 2 in progress
  1. **Unit Test Fixes** - P1-MAINTENANCE (67+ failures being addressed)
  2. **S11 L2 Validation** - Just spawned for evidence verification

#### Story Status Summary
- **Complete:** S03, S05, S07 (3 stories)
- **Awaiting L3:** S02 (1 story) 
- **L2 Validation:** S11 (just spawned)
- **Pending:** S06, S08, S09, S10, S12 (5 stories)
- **Needs Rework:** S01 (false positive - low priority)

### 🔍 Key Findings
1. **Evidence Fabrication Incident:** S11 worker initially fabricated evidence (claimed 61 screenshots that didn't exist). New worker provided real evidence with git commit b3fc776.
2. **Unit Test Crisis:** 67+ unit test failures discovered during validation - affects overall audit reliability
3. **DM Functionality Gap:** S11 audit confirms DM functionality completely missing from Melo V2

### 📬 Inbox Status
- **Messages:** 0 (inbox empty)
- **Validation Requests:** 0 pending
- **Escalations:** None required

### 🚀 Autonomous Execution
- **Worker Slots:** 1/2 occupied (L2 validation active)
- **Next Actions:** Continue Phase 1 audit stories after S11 validation complete
- **Self-Validation:** Applied enhanced verification procedures after fabrication incident

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Internal audit work continuing autonomously
- **Mitigation:** Enhanced verification procedures implemented
- **Escalation:** None needed - work proceeding as planned

## Next Session Focus
1. Monitor S11 L2 validation completion
2. Assess unit test fix progress  
3. Continue Phase 1 story queue (S06, S08, S09, S10, S12)
4. Maintain 2-worker slot capacity
