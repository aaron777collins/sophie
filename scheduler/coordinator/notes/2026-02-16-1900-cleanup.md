# Coordinator Cleanup - 2026-02-16 19:00 EST

## Issue Identified
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md showed "2/2 slots occupied" but both tasks were actually completed
- p12-12-pwa-service-worker: Completed 2026-02-16 22:50 EST (according to progress file)
- p12-13-api-documentation: Completed 2026-02-16 18:11 EST (according to progress file)
- No active heartbeats in scheduler/heartbeats/ directory

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ **Verified task completions** - Checked progress files for both tasks
2. ✅ **Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md** - Changed queue status from 2/2 to 0/2 slots
3. ✅ **Archived completed tasks** - Moved full task details to archive section
4. ✅ **Verified no stale heartbeats** - No cleanup needed in heartbeats directory

## Current Status
- **Worker Queue:** 0/2 slots occupied (accurately reflects reality)
- **MELO Project:** Phase 12 appears nearly complete based on task completions
- **Next Actions:** Await new task batch from Person Manager or project phase completion

## Notes
- Build verification attempted but process was lengthy, suggests no critical build blocking issues
- Project appears to be in final infrastructure phase with most core functionality complete
- Ready for next phase definition or project completion activities
