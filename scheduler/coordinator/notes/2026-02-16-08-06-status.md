# Coordinator Status — 2026-02-16 08:06 EST

## Situation
- **MELO Implementation:** Active with 4 pending tasks
- **Workers:** 0/2 slots occupied — ready for pickup
- **Inbox:** Empty — no messages from Person Manager or workers
- **Heartbeats:** None — no stale tasks to cleanup

## Task Queue Analysis

### High Priority (2 tasks)
1. **p10-12-invite-system-completion** — Complete invite system features (expiry, tracking, revocation)
2. **p11-14-mobile-chat-ux** — Mobile optimization for chat experience

### Medium Priority (2 tasks) 
3. **p12-1-service-worker-foundation** — PWA foundation
4. **p9-7-emoji-autocomplete** — Chat emoji picker

## Worker Spawn Strategy
- Spawn HIGH priority tasks first (p10-12, p11-14)
- Both require Sonnet model for complexity
- Let them run, monitor progress in next check
- Medium tasks can wait for next cycle if slots fill

## Progress Context
- Phase 9: 7/8 complete (88%) — p9-7 will bring to 100%
- Phase 10: 12/14 complete (86%) — p10-12 will bring to 93%
- Phase 11: 7/15 complete (47%) — p11-14 continues UX improvements
- Phase 12: 4/16 complete (25%) — p12-1 foundation work

## Actions This Cycle
1. Spawn worker for p10-12-invite-system-completion
2. Spawn worker for p11-14-mobile-chat-ux
3. Monitor and report back to Person Manager

## Next Check Focus
- Verify these spawned workers are making progress
- Check for completion claims requiring verification
- Spawn medium tasks if high tasks complete
