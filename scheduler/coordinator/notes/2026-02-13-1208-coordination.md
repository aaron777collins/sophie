## Inbox Processing

### Person Manager Message — Build Assessment
- **Received:** PM message about HAOS v2 build assessment
- **Key Finding:** Documented 'use-spaces hook' issue was stale
- **Actual Issue:** 22+ TypeScript errors (server components, LiveKit API, Prisma/Matrix enums)
- **PM Actions:** Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with correct task scope, updated JOBS.md

### Response Sent
- Confirmed current worker status (build-fix-spaces-hook active since 15:15)
- Worker has fixed identified issues: iconMap audio type, MatrixSpace mismatches
- Build verification in progress
- No additional spawning needed

## Current Task Status

### build-fix-spaces-hook
- **Worker:** Sonnet (active since 15:15 EST)
- **Status:** Nearly complete, verifying final build
- **Issues Fixed:**
  - iconMap missing 'audio' type → added Mic
  - MatrixSpace type mismatches → provided complete objects with defaults
- **Heartbeat:** Active (last update 15:31 per progress file)

## Assessment

- Person Manager's build assessment was accurate and helpful
- Worker is progressing well on the actual TypeScript errors
- No coordination issues - letting active worker complete
- Build success will unblock normal task progression

## Next Actions

- Monitor build completion
- Update JOBS.md when worker reports completion
- Resume normal task coordination once build passes
