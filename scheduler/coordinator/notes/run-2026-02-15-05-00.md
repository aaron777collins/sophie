## Status Overview
- **Active Project:** HAOS Full Implementation (Phases 8-12)  
- **Current Focus:** Phase 9 (Chat Features) + Phase 10 (Server Features)
- **Slot Usage:** 0/2 active (slots available for new tasks)

## Task Completions Detected

### ✅ p9-4-mentions (Just completed)
- **Status:** completed at ~04:38 EST
- **Worker:** haos-p9-4-mentions (session active until recently)
- **Deliverables:** MentionAutocomplete component, useMentions hook, chat integration
- **Next:** Mark as completed in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md

### ✅ p10-1-role-ui (Just completed)

- **Worker:** haos-p10-1-role-ui (session active until recently)
- **Deliverables:** Role management UI, server settings integration
- **Next:** Mark as completed in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md

## Current Task Status
According to PROACTIVE-JOBS.md, slots should be occupied by:
- p9-1-message-editing (haos-p9-1-edit)
- p9-2-message-deletion (haos-p9-2-delete)

However, these sessions are NOT active in sessions_list, indicating they either:
1. Were never spawned 
2. Completed and cleaned up
3. Failed/timed out

## Actions Required
1. Update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with actual completed tasks
2. Spawn new high-priority tasks to fill available slots
3. Maintain task pipeline for continuous progress

## Next Priority Tasks (Ready to Spawn)
Based on HAOS jobs file priority:
1. **p10-2-role-creation** (depends on p10-1 ✅ complete)
2. **p10-6-user-kick** (no dependencies)  
3. **p10-7-user-ban** (no dependencies)
4. **p9-1-message-editing** (if not actually complete)
5. **p9-2-message-deletion** (if not actually complete)

## Recommendations
- Spawn 2 new workers immediately to maintain velocity
- Prioritize p10 tasks (Server Features) as they're marked HIGH priority
- Verify actual status of p9-1 and p9-2 tasks
