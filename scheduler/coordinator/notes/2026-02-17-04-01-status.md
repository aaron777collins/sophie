## Current Situation Overview

**MELO Build Recovery: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS**

### What Was Found
- Project was marked "100% complete" on 2026-02-16 but build was actually failing
- Multiple dependency issues discovered (missing `otplib`, web-push conflicts, security vulnerabilities)
- Project completion audit revealed gap between claims and reality

### What's Been Fixed (By Sub-Agents)
1. ✅ **Build Issues Resolved** — All TypeScript compilation errors fixed, production build now passes
2. ✅ **Security Vulnerabilities Fixed** — All 7 npm security issues resolved (Next.js, matrix-js-sdk upgrades)
3. ✅ **Comprehensive Audit Completed** — Found project is actually ~85% complete, not 100% as claimed

### Current State
- **Build Status:** ✅ Passing (exit code 0, 44/44 pages generated)
- **Security:** ✅ All vulnerabilities resolved
- **Worker Queue:** 0/2 slots occupied (all recent tasks completed)
- **Main Blocker:** None - recovery tasks have been successful

### Key Lessons Learned
- **CRITICAL:** Never mark project complete without build verification
- Build validation must be part of completion criteria
- Multiple sub-agents can effectively parallelize recovery work

## Actions Taken This Period
1. Reviewed completed sub-agent work on build fixes
2. Confirmed security vulnerability resolution
3. Verified build is now passing
4. Updated understanding of project state

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any additional issues
- Consider final project validation once build fully stable
- Report successful recovery to Person Manager

## Notes
- Recovery effort showcases the importance of proper validation before completion claims
- Sub-agent architecture worked well for parallel problem resolution
