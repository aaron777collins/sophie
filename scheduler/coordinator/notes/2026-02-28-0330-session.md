# Coordinator Session - 2026-02-28 03:30 EST

## Actions Taken

### 1. Processed Validation Results ✅
- **ST-P2-01-A:** Validator result PASS - Updated to complete
- **ST-P2-01-C:** Validator result PASS - Updated to complete  
- **Archived:** Both validation messages to coordinator/archive/

### 2. Prioritization Decision: Browser Automation First 🚨
- **Analysis:** Browser Automation marked P0-CRITICAL, blocking all validation
- **Issue:** Chrome extension relay consistently failing, no screenshot capability
- **Decision:** Start Browser Automation immediately despite MELO tasks ready

### 3. Spawned Story Architect ⚡
- **Target:** Browser Automation EPIC-01 (Playwright Setup & Validation)
- **Session:** story-architect-browser-automation (Opus)
- **Task:** Create 3-4 user stories for Playwright establishment
- **Goal:** Get ready for immediate Sonnet worker execution

### 4. Added MELO Sub-Tasks for Future Spawning 📋
- **ST-P2-01-D:** Successful Registration Flow (AC-4) - Sonnet
- **ST-P2-01-E:** Username Already Exists Error (AC-5) - Sonnet  
- **ST-P2-01-F:** Mobile Responsive Design (AC-8) - Haiku
- **Status:** All pending, ready to spawn when capacity allows

## Current Situation

### Worker Slots: 1/2 Occupied
- **Active:** story-architect-browser-automation (creating user stories)
- **Available:** 1 slot for immediate work

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Check Story Architect completion** - spawn Playwright testing if ready
2. **Spawn MELO sub-task** if Browser Automation not ready yet
3. **Continue autonomous execution** with validation gates

## Validation Status

### Recently Completed (L3 Validated)
- ST-P2-01-A: Homepage Registration Link ✅
- ST-P2-01-C: Registration Form Validation ✅

### Progress on US-P2-01 Registration Implementation
- **Complete:** AC-1 (homepage link), AC-2 (login page link), AC-6/7/9 (form validation)
- **Remaining:** AC-4 (successful flow), AC-5 (error handling), AC-8 (mobile)
- **Status:** 60% complete, core functionality pending

## Risk Assessment

### Browser Automation Risk
- **High Priority Correct:** This is indeed blocking all validation
- **Story Quality Critical:** User stories must be detailed enough for immediate execution
- **Timeline Pressure:** Aaron wants this "done right" - no rushing

### MELO Momentum Risk  
- **Mitigation:** Added sub-tasks to queue for quick spawning
- **Impact:** Slight delay acceptable given P0-CRITICAL blocking issue

## Notes

- Followed security protocol - all validation results from trusted Validator agent
- Applied autonomous execution - didn't wait for Person Manager permission to spawn Story Architect  
- Quality gates maintained - both completed tasks had proper L3 validation
- Documentation updated - PROACTIVE-JOBS.md reflects current reality

## Next Heartbeat Focus

1. Check story-architect-browser-automation completion
2. Spawn first Playwright testing task if stories ready  
3. Maintain 2/2 worker slot utilization
4. Monitor validation pipeline for any issues
