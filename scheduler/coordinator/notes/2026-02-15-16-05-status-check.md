# Coordinator Status Check — 2026-02-15 16:05 EST

## Summary
- **Inbox:** Empty (0 messages)
- **Projects:** HAOS Full Implementation (critical recovery status)
- **Tasks:** 0 active, all current tasks completed
- **Cleanup:** No stale heartbeats to process

## Current Situation

### HAOS Project Status
- **JOBS.md Status:** Critical recovery in progress
- **Expected:** 25 complete, 31 pending tasks
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Reality:** All current tasks completed
- **Phase 8 (Security Polish):** ✅ COMPLETE (3/3 tasks done)

### Recent Completions
- `p8-2-security-prompts` completed at 18:30 EST (security prompts for sensitive actions)
- `p8-3-encryption-ui` completed (encryption status UI in chat header)
- `p10-6-slowmode` completed at 18:15 EST (channel slowmode settings)

## Status Discrepancy Analysis

**Issue:** Disconnect between Coordinator JOBS.md expectations and actual task queue state.

**JOBS.md shows:**
- 31 pending tasks across phases 9-12
- Worker slots should be 2/2 occupied
- Critical tasks waiting: mobile navigation, settings layout, emoji autocomplete

**PROACTIVE-JOBS.md shows:**
- All queued tasks completed
- No active workers
- No pending tasks

## Action Needed

**AWAITING:** Person Manager guidance on:
1. Next phase activation (Phase 9: Chat Features?)
2. Task queue population for remaining 31 pending tasks
3. Worker slot utilization strategy

## Next Steps
- Monitor for Person Manager inbox messages
- Ready to populate PROACTIVE-JOBS.md when directed
- Available to spawn workers for next phase tasks
