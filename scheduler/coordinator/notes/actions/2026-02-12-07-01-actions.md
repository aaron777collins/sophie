# Coordinator Actions - 2026-02-12 07:01 EST

## Analysis Completed
- ✅ Checked inbox (empty)
- ✅ Reviewed PROACTIVE-JOBS.md status
- ✅ Analyzed active sessions vs completed tasks
- ✅ Identified stale heartbeats and session cleanup needs

## Actions Taken

### 1. Status Assessment
- **Phase 1 Progress:** ~80% complete (17/29 tasks done)
- **p1-2 (Sync):** 9/10 complete, only Socket.io cleanup remaining
- **p1-3 (Media):** 4/8 complete, tasks a-d done, e-h ready to queue

### 2. Task Queue Updates
- ✅ Added p1-3-e through p1-3-h to PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
- ✅ Updated status from "pending" to "in-progress" for e-g
- ✅ Added p1-3-h (UploadThing cleanup) as new task

### 3. Session Management
- ✅ Cleaned stale heartbeat: `haos-v2-matrix-image-p1-3-e.json`
- ✅ Spawned worker for p1-3-e (MatrixImage component)
- ⚠️ Attempted spawn for p1-3-f (FileUpload) - timeout but session created

### 4. Communication
- ✅ Sent status report to Person Manager
- ✅ Documented findings in coordinator notes

## Current Task Slots
- **Slot 1:** haos-v2-matrix-image-p1-3-e (active)
- **Slot 2:** haos-v2-file-upload-p1-3-f (spawning, may have timeout issue)

## Next Cycle Actions Needed
1. Monitor p1-3-e and p1-3-f progress
2. Queue p1-3-g when p1-3-e completes 
3. Follow up on p1-2-j (Socket.io cleanup) - may need escalation
4. Check if any other stale sessions need cleanup

## Observations
- Multiple completed tasks still showing active sessions - cleanup needed
- Phase 1 approaching completion - Phase 2 UI work can begin scaling up
- Socket.io cleanup task may be blocked - needs attention
