## Issue: Long-Pending Validation Requests

### Tasks Awaiting Validation (12+ hours)

1. **p3-2 - Gateway Architecture Migration**
   - Sent to validator: 2026-02-24 23:15 EST
   - Status: Self-validated (L2) 
   - Validation request: `1771993009-val-req-p3-2.json`
   - Duration: 12+ hours

2. **p3-3 - Comprehensive Telemetry System** 
   - Sent to validator: 2026-02-24 23:21 EST
   - Status: Self-validated (L2)
   - Validation request: `1771993361-val-req-p3-3.json`
   - Duration: 12+ hours

### Actions Taken

- ✅ Updated p3-1 to complete (validator approved)
- ⚠️ Noted unusually long validation queue times

### Next Steps

- Monitor validator response times
- Consider escalation if no response within 24 hours
- Both tasks are high-quality documentation/architecture work with comprehensive test coverage

## Project Status

- **Phase 3:** 1/3 tasks complete (p3-1), 2/3 awaiting L3 validation
- **Overall:** Proactive Job System Enhancement nearly complete
- **Quality:** All L2 validations passed with high confidence
