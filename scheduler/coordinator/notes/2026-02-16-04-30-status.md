### HAOS Full Implementation — Current Status Assessment
- **Jobs File Status:** 🔴 Critical Recovery listed, but reality check needed
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Status:** 0 active tasks, 1 recently completed (p11-6-user-notification-system)
- **Phase Status:** Based on 2026-02-15 audit: 25/56 tasks complete (45% done)

#### Recent Task Completions Found
- **p9-7-emoji-autocomplete:** ✅ Complete (found in progress files)
- **p10-5-role-badges:** ✅ Complete (found in progress files) 
- **p11-6-user-notification-system:** ✅ Complete (recorded in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md)

#### Issue Identified
- **Task Status Synchronization Problem:** Completed tasks in progress files not reflected in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
- **Queue Management:** No pending tasks currently active despite jobs file indicating 31 pending

## Cleanup Status
- **Heartbeats:** No stale heartbeats found (scheduler/heartbeats/ empty)
- **Worker Slots:** 0/2 occupied (no active workers)

## Actions Taken
- Reviewed progress files for completed tasks
- Confirmed no active workers or pending tasks
- No messages to process

## Recommendations
1. **Task Sync Audit:** Need to reconcile completed tasks in progress files with PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
2. **Queue Population:** If HAOS phases still need work, tasks should be populated from approved phase plans
3. **Status Update:** Jobs file should reflect current reality (may be mostly complete rather than "critical recovery")
