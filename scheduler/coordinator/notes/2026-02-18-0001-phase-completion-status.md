### Project Status: MELO
- **P0 Phase**: Fully complete (6/6 tasks)
  - Admin invites UI working
  - Login integration with invite checking
  - Signup invite code handling
  - Private mode fixes deployed
  - E2E tests substantially resolved

- **P1 High Priority**: Initial tasks complete (2/2)
  - P1-4: 2FA test infrastructure fixed (91 tests vs 73 before)
  - P1-5: Complete offline email notification system

### Worker Status
- Both slots available
- No pending tasks in queue
- All recent progress files show completion

### Strategic Position

Await Person Manager direction on next phase priorities. All tactical execution completed at current level.
