# Phase 1 Self-Validated — 2026-02-18 17:50 EST

## Worker Completion

MELO-UI-FIX-P1 completed successfully in ~17 minutes (17:30-17:47 EST).

### Deliverables Verified

1. **Discord Clone Repo** ✅
   - Location: `/tmp/discord-clone-ref`
   - Full component structure present (navigation/, server/, chat/, modals/, ui/)
   - package.json exists

2. **Mapping Document** ✅
   - Location: `/home/ubuntu/repos/melo/docs/DISCORD-CLONE-MAPPING.md`
   - Comprehensive: CSS variables, colors (exact hex), typography, spacing
   - Component-by-component mapping table
   - Implementation priority (P2-1 through P4)
   - Phase 2 approach strategy

3. **Screenshots** ⚠️ Deferred
   - Directory created: `/home/ubuntu/repos/melo/docs/reference-screenshots/`
   - Not captured: discord-clone requires Clerk auth to run
   - Acceptable: code patterns well documented

## Actions Taken

1. Self-validated the work (checked repo, mapping doc, design tokens)
2. Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md status to `self-validated (L2-coordinator)`
3. Sent validation request to Validator inbox
4. Added Phase 2 tasks (P2-1, P2-2, P2-3) to PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
5. Updated work stoppage notice to reflect progress

## Next Steps

1. **Awaiting Validator** — Will independently verify deliverables
2. **On approval** — Start Phase 2 with MELO-UI-FIX-P2-1 (Global CSS Variables)
3. **All Phase 2 work** — Must use Sonnet/Opus (NO HAIKU for UI)

## Key Lesson Applied

Phase 1 used Opus as required. Phase 2 tasks explicitly marked as Sonnet-only. The mapping document provides explicit reference so workers know exactly what to copy.

## Files Changed

- `~/clawd/PROACTIVE-JOBS.md` — Status updates, Phase 2 tasks added
- `~/clawd/scheduler/inboxes/validator/1739918100-val-req-melo-ui-fix-p1.json` — Validation request
