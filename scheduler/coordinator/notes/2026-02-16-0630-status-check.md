# Coordinator Status Check - 2026-02-16 06:30 EST

## Current Situation Analysis

### Key Findings
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md**: Shows 0 active tasks, most recent completion was p11-6-user-notification-system 
- **Coordinator JOBS.md**: Still lists HAOS as active with HIGH PRIORITY tasks that don't appear in queue
- **Session Activity**: Recent completed work on p11-13-mobile-navigation visible in session logs
- **Worker Status**: 0/2 slots occupied (no workers currently running)

### Discrepancy Identified
The coordinator JOBS.md references critical tasks that are not showing up in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md:
- p11-13-mobile-navigation (CRITICAL — Mobile audit findings)  
- p11-1-settings-layout (HIGH — Settings UX)
- p9-7-emoji-autocomplete (HIGH — Chat completion)
- p8-3-encryption-ui (HIGH — Security polish)

### Session Evidence Shows Completion
Session logs indicate p11-13-mobile-navigation was actually completed by agent `540294a4-177d-4aa7-aba9-d6b3d57d94b2` with comprehensive mobile navigation fixes.

### Assessment
The system appears to be in a state where:
1. Tasks are being completed but status tracking may be out of sync
2. PROACTIVE-JOBS.md may need updating to reflect actual remaining work
3. No immediate work appears to be pending based on current queue status

### Action Taken
- Documented current status
- No worker spawning needed due to empty queue
- Status report provided to Person Manager level

## Recommendations
- Person Manager should audit current HAOS phase status vs PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
- Verify which tasks from coordinator JOBS.md are actually still pending
- Update both coordinator JOBS.md and PROACTIVE-JOBS.md for consistency
