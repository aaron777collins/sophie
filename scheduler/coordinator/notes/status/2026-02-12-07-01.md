## Current State Analysis

### Task Slots (Max 2)
- **Active Sessions:** Multiple sub-agents running but most appear to be completed tasks
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md:** Shows only 1 pending task (haos-v2-remove-socketio-p1-2-j)
- **Observation:** Many active sessions show tasks marked "completed" in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md

### Phase 1 Status
| Section | Status | Progress |
|---------|--------|----------|
| p1-1: Auth | ✅ Complete | 5/5 |
| p1-2: Sync | 🔄 9/10 (90% done) | Only p1-2-j pending |
| p1-3: Media | 🔄 4/8 (50% done) | a-d completed, e-h pending |

### Key Findings
1. **p1-2 (Sync) nearly complete** — Only Socket.io cleanup task remains
2. **p1-3 (Media) progressing** — 4 of 8 tasks completed
3. **Phase 2 tasks running** — p2-3-a and p2-3-b appear completed
4. **Stale heartbeats** — Some sessions may be finished but still show as "running"

### Next Actions Required
1. **Clean up stale sessions** — Check if completed tasks need heartbeat cleanup
2. **Queue p1-3 remaining tasks** — Tasks e-h are ready (depends completed)
3. **Verify completion status** — Ensure PROACTIVE-JOBS.md reflects actual state
4. **Assess phase transition** — p1-2 completion would enable p1-3 focus

## Recommendations for Person Manager
- Phase 1 is ~80% complete (17/29 tasks done)
- Media upload section needs attention (4 more tasks to queue)
- Socket.io cleanup task may be blocked or need different model size
- Phase 2 UI work is running ahead of schedule (good progress)
