# Coordinator Status Check — 2026-02-17 03:01 EST

## Situation Analysis

### MELO Project Status Gap
- **JOBS.md Claims:** Project 100% complete (as of 2026-02-16 22:30)
- **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Reality:** Build recovery mode, significant issues remain
- **Root Issue:** Completion was claimed without proper build validation

### Current Active Issues
1. **Build validation in progress** — npm run build currently running
2. **Failed sub-agent** — melo-web-push-build-fix agent died due to model 404 error (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
3. **Task queue** — 1/2 slots used but failed agent needs replacement

### Evidence of Incomplete State
- Missing dependencies (otplib was missing)
- Build failures due to Node.js/browser incompatibility (web-push library)
- Security vulnerabilities present
- Static page generation errors

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Running build validation manually to assess current state
2. 🔄 Will spawn replacement sub-agent for web-push fix with correct model
3. 📋 Documenting discrepancy between claimed vs actual completion

## Next Steps
1. Wait for build completion/failure results
2. Spawn new web-push build fix agent with valid model (sonnet)
3. Update JOBS.md to reflect actual reality vs claimed completion
4. Report to Person Manager about completion validation issues

## Key Learning
⚠️ **Build validation MUST be part of completion criteria**
Never claim 100% complete without successful production build verification.
