# Worker Spawn - 2026-02-15 09:31 EST

## Action Taken
Spawned 2 workers to maintain MELO implementation momentum:

### Workers Spawned
1. **melo-p10-5-role-badges** (Haiku)
   - Task: Show role badges next to usernames
   - Session: agent:main:subagent:b6e9dd1e-9626-49f0-b6ef-c79cbc54a52d
   - Priority: LOW (but dependency-free)

2. **melo-p11-3-notification-settings** (Sonnet)  
   - Task: Create notification settings page
   - Session: agent:main:subagent:d68e71e8-764a-4b53-9a2a-9e0957c3d407
   - Priority: MEDIUM

## Strategy
- Maintained 2/2 worker slots occupied
- Selected tasks from different phases (P10 & P11) for parallel progress
- Both tasks have satisfied dependencies
- Mix of Haiku and Sonnet for different complexity levels

## Status Updates
- Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with in-progress status
- Added worker session IDs and start times
- Both workers have full completion templates

## Current Capacity
- Worker slots: 2/2 OCCUPIED
- Phases progressing: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
- Next spawn: When current workers complete
