## Significant Progress - Critical Blockers Resolved

### 🎉 Major Breakthrough
**Both critical blockers preventing MELO V2 audit progression have been RESOLVED:**

1. **DEF-003 (Application Loading):** ✅ RESOLVED by commit 410942d
   - MatrixAuthProvider infinite loop fixed
   - PM2 stable 60+ minutes, no more restarts
   - HTTP 200 responses confirmed

2. **DEF-004 (HTTPS Upgrade Policy):** ✅ RESOLVED by def-004-fix worker
   - CSP `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive removed for development
   - Browser automation now works at localhost:3000
   - All SSL protocol errors eliminated

### ✅ Completed This Heartbeat

1. **S04 Create Server Audit** - Self-validated and sent to L3 Validator
   - Worker verified both critical blockers resolved
   - Comprehensive test infrastructure created  
   - Ready for final validation approval

2. **Pipeline Unblocked** - Spawned next audit stories immediately
   - **S07 Create Channel** - MELO-P1-S07 worker active
   - **S05 Join Server** - MELO-P1-S05 worker active
   - Both running in parallel as dependencies are met

3. **Status Updates** - Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with current progress

### 📊 Current Audit Status

| Story | Status | Worker | Expected Completion |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| S01 Registration | needs-rework | - | TBD (false positive) |
| S02 Login | awaiting-l3-validation | - | Pending Validator |
| S03 Logout | ✅ complete | - | Done |
| S04 Create Server | self-validated | - | Pending L3 validation |
| S05 Join Server | in-progress | MELO-P1-S05 | ~08:55 EST |
| S07 Create Channel | in-progress | MELO-P1-S07 | ~08:55 EST |

### 🚀 Impact

- **Audit pipeline fully unblocked** - No more infrastructure barriers
- **Browser automation working** - Playwright tests can execute properly
- **Parallel execution active** - 2 audit stories running simultaneously  
- **Quality maintained** - All validation protocols followed
- **Clear progression path** - S06, S08, S09+ ready to queue after current batch

### 🔍 Next Heartbeat Actions

1. Monitor S05/S07 worker progress
2. Process any validation results from L3 Validator
3. Queue next batch of audit stories (S06 Leave Server, S08 Delete Channel)
4. Handle any blockers or escalations

**Assessment:** Critical breakthrough achieved. MELO V2 audit is now progressing at full capacity with no infrastructure blockers.
