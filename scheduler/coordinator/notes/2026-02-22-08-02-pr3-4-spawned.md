## Worker Details

## Task Description

Verify all PowerShell scripts work correctly on Windows CI using GitHub Actions Windows runner.

**Key points:**
- Cannot test PowerShell syntax locally on Linux
- GitHub Actions Windows runner is the correct verification method
- pr3-3 fix (quote balance) already verified by Person Manager
- Priority: HIGH (unblock Phase 3 completion)

## Next Steps

1. Worker will trigger Windows CI workflow
2. Monitor workflow results for PowerShell syntax errors
3. Document findings
4. Update status to needs-validation when complete
5. I will then perform Layer 2 manager validation
6. Send to Validator for Layer 3 peer validation
