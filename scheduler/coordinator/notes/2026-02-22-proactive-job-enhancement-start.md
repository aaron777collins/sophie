**Date:** 2026-02-22 04:30 EST
**Author:** Coordinator
**Action:** Started new approved project

## Context

Found approved master plan at `docs/plans/proactive-job-system-enhancement/MASTER-PLAN.md`:
- **Status:** Approved (direct request from Aaron)
- **Author:** Sophie (L0) 
- **Goal:** Make acceptance criteria and testing mandatory for all tasks

## Actions Taken

1. **Created Phase Plans:**
   - `PHASE-1.md`: Core Documentation Updates (4 categories, 9 tasks)
   - `PHASE-2.md`: Implementation & Testing (4 categories, 11 tasks)

2. **Spawned Phase Reviewer:** 
   - Session: `agent:main:subagent:90d1117a-9958-4055-90b6-55d7cdc53d00`
   - Task: Review both phase plans for approval

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Await phase review results
   - Incorporate feedback if needed  
   - Send to Person Manager for approval
   - Begin populating PROACTIVE-JOBS.md with tasks

## Phase 1 Overview

**Focus:** Update documentation to mandate testing
- Update AGENTS.md with mandatory testing requirements
- Update all agent IDENTITY.md files  
- Enhance PROACTIVE-JOBS.md template
- Update planning system docs
- Integrate critical thinking workflow

## Phase 2 Overview  

**Focus:** Test and validate the enhanced system
- Create test tasks using new template
- Validate agent behavior follows new requirements
- Test critical thinking integration
- Complete documentation and commit changes

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2
- All tasks use Sonnet (thinking required) except final commits (Haiku)
- Critical thinking tasks require Opus for depth

## Expected Timeline

- Phase 1: ~1 day (documentation updates)
- Phase 2: ~1 day (testing and validation)
- Total: ~2 days for significant system improvement

This addresses Aaron's direct request to make testing and validation mandatory throughout the system.
