## Active Project Status: melo-v2

### Build Status Assessment
- **Critical Build Issue:** Listed as completed in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md
- **Current Verification:** Running `npm run build` to verify resolution

### Task Progress Review

- 🔄 p3-presence: IN PROGRESS
  - ✅ p3-2-a: Send typing indicators (COMPLETED per progress file)
  - ⏳ p3-2-b: Display typing indicators (PENDING)

### Active Sessions Detected
1. **p3-presence** (Haiku, 45min old) — May be stale
2. **p3-presence-typing-start** (Haiku, 13min old) — Working on completed task
3. **build-fix-spaces-hook** (Sonnet, 47min old) — Task marked completed

### Cleanup Assessment
- p3-presence-typing-start: Working on already completed p3-2-a
- Potential stale worker states need cleanup
- Need to verify build success before marking build-fix as truly complete

## Next Actions
1. ✅ Verify build completion
2. Clean up stale worker sessions if build succeeds
3. Update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md task states
4. Spawn new worker for p3-2-b if needed
