## 🔍 Analysis

### P2 Phase Status
- Only 2 tasks defined in P2 phase (P2-1, P2-2)
- P2-1 completed and verified
- P2-2 now actively being worked on
- No additional P2 tasks identified

### Next Actions Considered
1. **Wait for P2-2 completion** - P2-2 may unlock additional tasks or reveal next steps
