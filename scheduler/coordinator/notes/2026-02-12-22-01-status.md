## Current State Assessment
1. **Phase 4 appears largely complete** - Multiple tasks show completion in progress files
2. **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md needs update** - Only shows 1 of 3 completed Phase 4 tasks
3. **No active work** - No workers running, no pending tasks visible
4. **Potential missing tasks** - Phase 4 has more than 3 total tasks based on project scope

## Action Required
**PROACTIVE-JOBS.md audit needed** - Progress files show more completions than jobs file reflects.

## Next Steps
1. Review complete PROACTIVE-JOBS.md to identify missing Phase 4 tasks
2. Update task statuses to reflect actual completion state
3. Determine if Phase 4 is complete or if additional tasks need to be added

## Status for Person Manager
- No immediate worker spawning needed
- System appears to be in a completion/transition state
- Requires strategic review of Phase 4 completion status
