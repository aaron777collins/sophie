# Coordinator Status Check — 2026-02-14 00:01 EST

## Findings

### Project Status: HAOS v2
- **Status:** Phase 5 COMPLETE, deployed and running
- **URL:** http://dev2.aaroncollins.info:3000 ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
- **Current State:** Awaiting strategic direction from Person Manager

### Information Conflicts Found
1. **PROACTIVE-JOBS.md** shows Phase 5 as "DEPLOYMENT FAILED" 
2. **Coordinator JOBS.md** shows Phase 5 as "COMPLETE — Awaiting strategic direction"
3. **Deployment progress file** shows deployment as "INCOMPLETE"
4. **Reality:** Site is actually deployed and working fine

### Assessment
- Deployment actually succeeded despite progress files showing failures
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md needs cleanup to reflect true status
- No active work for coordination - project awaiting PM direction

### Actions Taken
- Verified site is live and working
- Documented status discrepancy for future cleanup
- No coordination work required at this time

## Inbox Status
- No messages in coordinator inbox

## Next Steps
- Await strategic direction from Person Manager
- Clean up stale status information when work resumes
