## Actions Taken
1. **Verified worker slot availability** - Previous workers (melo-p9-1-edit, melo-p9-2-delete) no longer active
2. **Spawned 2 new workers:**
   - `melo-p9-4-mentions` (Sonnet) - @mentions autocomplete functionality
   - `melo-p10-1-role-ui` (Sonnet) - Role management UI for server settings
3. **Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md status:**
   - p9-4-mentions: pending → in-progress  
   - p10-1-role-ui: pending → in-progress

## Current Worker Slots
- **Slot 1:** p9-4-mentions (melo-p9-4-mentions) - Chat features
- **Slot 2:** p10-1-role-ui (melo-p10-1-role-ui) - Server features  
- **Utilization:** 2/2 slots active

## Next High Priority Queue
When current workers complete:
1. p10-6-user-kick (Sonnet, HIGH) - User kick functionality
2. p10-7-user-ban (Sonnet, HIGH) - User ban functionality  
3. p11-1-settings-layout (Sonnet, HIGH) - Settings page layout
4. p11-12-mobile-audit (Sonnet, HIGH) - Mobile responsiveness

## Notes
- Both spawned tasks have clear success criteria and completion checklists

- Continuing focus on HIGH priority tasks that have no dependencies
- Mix of chat features (P9) and server management (P10) to advance multiple areas
