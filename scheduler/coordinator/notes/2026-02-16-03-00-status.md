# Coordinator Status Check - 2026-02-16 03:00 EST

## Situation Assessment

### Current Active Work
- **1 task in-progress:** `p11-6-user-notification-system` 
- **Worker:** agent:main:subagent:31f09edb-aa9a-440a-b3bc-f13773b94453 (Sonnet)
- **Status:** Implementation appears complete, experiencing build issue with TypeScript/Turbopack
- **Worker Slots:** 1/2 occupied

### Key Findings
1. **Previous reports of HIGH priority tasks being incomplete were inaccurate**
   - Tasks like p11-1, p9-7, p8-3, p11-13, p12-1 appear to already be completed
   - Status documentation in JOBS.md is outdated
   
2. **Current worker is actively resolving issues**
   - Has implemented all 5 required components for notification system
   - Encountering build configuration issue with Next.js Turbopack
   - Worker appears competent and making progress

### No Action Required
- **No additional tasks to spawn** - PROACTIVE-JOBS.md shows no pending work
- **No stale heartbeats to clean up** - No heartbeat files found
- **No inbox messages** - Coordinator inbox is empty

### Recommendations
1. **Allow current worker to continue** - Build issue appears solvable
2. **Status audit needed** - Many "HIGH priority" tasks in JOBS.md may already be complete
3. **Await worker completion** - Implementation looks comprehensive and nearly finished

## Worker Progress Summary
The notification system implementation includes:
- ✅ In-app notification center with full UI
- ✅ Email notification service with templates  
- ✅ Push notification integration with service worker
- ✅ Enhanced settings UI with backend integration
- ✅ Template system for reusable notifications

Build issue appears to be a known Next.js 16 + Turbopack compatibility problem with simple fix.

## Next Check
Will monitor for worker completion and update status documentation once task finishes.
