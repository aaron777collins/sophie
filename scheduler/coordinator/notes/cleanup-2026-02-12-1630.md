# Task Cleanup — 2026-02-12 16:30 EST

## Stale Task States Corrected

### melo-v2-first-run-experience-p3-4-1
- **Previous State:** in-progress (since 2026-02-12 16:15 EST)
- **Actual State:** COMPLETED (2026-02-15 23:11 EST)
- **Evidence:** Progress file `/home/ubuntu/clawd/scheduler/progress/melo-v2-first-run-experience.md` shows full completion
- **Action:** Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md status to COMPLETED ✅

### melo-v2-voice-channel-ui-p3-5-1
- **Previous State:** in-progress (since 2026-02-12 16:30 EST)
- **Actual State:** No work done (no progress file or heartbeat found)
- **Evidence:** No progress files, no heartbeats, no actual work traces
- **Action:** Reset status to pending in PROACTIVE-JOBS.md

## Context
- No active heartbeat files found in scheduler/heartbeats/
- Both tasks were marked in-progress but only first-run had actual work done
- Voice channel UI task needs fresh spawn when Task Managers pick it up

## Impact
- PROACTIVE-JOBS.md now reflects accurate task states
- First-run experience task properly marked complete (was blocking accurate project status)
- Voice channel UI task available for new worker assignment

## Next Steps
- Voice channel UI task ready for Task Manager pickup
- Phase 3 progress more accurately reflected
- Cleanup prevented duplicate work on already-completed tasks
