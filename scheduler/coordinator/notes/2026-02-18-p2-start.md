# Coordinator Notes - P2 Phase Start

**Date:** 2026-02-18 00:30 EST  
**Phase Transition:** P0/P1 → P2  

## Situation Analysis

### Completed Work ✅
- **P0**: All blocker tasks completed and validated
- **P1-3**: Security audit completed - no vulnerability found
- **P1-4**: 2FA tests enabled and running (73→91 tests)
- **P1-5**: Email notification system fully implemented

### Current Phase: P2 Voice/Video Infrastructure

**Decision:** Began P2 autonomous execution following completion of P1 phase.

**Rationale:**
- Both worker slots were available (2/2 free)
- P0/P1 substantially complete per progress file analysis
- Master plan clearly defines P2 as next high-priority phase
- Voice/video is core differentiator feature

### Actions Taken

1. **Updated PROACTIVE-JOBS.md** - Cleaned up completed P1 tasks, added P2 tasks
2. **Spawned P2-1 worker** (Opus) - MatrixRTC Backend Infrastructure
   - Session: a6d9891d-0dcf-446d-8c42-645807856cc2
   - Model: claude-opus-4-5 (HIGH complexity requirement)
   - Focus: LiveKit SFU + lk-jwt-service deployment

### Next Execution Cycle
- Monitor P2-1 progress
- Prepare P2-2 (Matrix SDK integration) for spawn
- Maintain autonomous execution pattern

### Technical Notes
P2 requires Element Call-level implementation:
- MatrixRTC protocol (Matrix + LiveKit)
- E2EE for voice/video calls
- MSC3266, MSC4140, MSC4222 enablement
- Security-critical configuration (`auto_create: false`)

## Status: AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MODE ✅
