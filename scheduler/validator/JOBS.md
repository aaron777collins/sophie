## Systemic Issues Being Tracked

### 1. Build Infrastructure Timeouts
- **Issue:** `pnpm build` sometimes hangs or times out
- **Impact:** Cannot always verify build passes
- **Workaround:** Check if build progresses beyond static generation
- **Status:** Known infrastructure issue, not blocking task quality

### 2. Unit Test Mock Configuration
- **Issue:** Some unit tests fail due to missing useModal mocks
- **Impact:** 90 out of 296 tests fail
- **Status:** Pre-existing issue, not related to new work
