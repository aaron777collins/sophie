**Validated:** 2026-02-20 17:40 EST  
**Requested by:** coordinator  
**Project:** PortableRalph Production Readiness  
**Phase:** Phase 3 (Windows Verification)

cd /home/ubuntu/repos/portableralph
=== DIRECTORY VERIFIED ===
/home/ubuntu/repos/portableralph
==========================
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] YAML parsing errors fixed in windows-test.yml — **FAIL**
- [ ] YAML validates without errors — **FAIL** 
- [ ] Workflow runs and creates jobs (not 0s failure) — **FAIL**
- [ ] Commit pushed with clear message — **FAIL**

## Critical Findings

### 1. File Does Not Exist
```bash
$ ls -la .github/workflows/
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Feb 20 10:32 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Jan 19 10:10 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1104 Jan 19 10:10 docs.yml
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1665 Jan 19 10:10 release.yml
```

**CRITICAL:** The file `.github/workflows/windows-test.yml` does NOT exist. Only `docs.yml` and `release.yml` are present.

### 2. Commit Does Not Exist  
```bash
$ git show 1d402f4
fatal: ambiguous argument '1d402f4': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
```

**CRITICAL:** Commit `1d402f4` claimed in validation request does not exist in the repository.

### 3. Recent Git History
```bash
$ git log --oneline | head -5
07a350c Implement a Docker sandbox for Ralph
aeb15da feat: Add Claude Code skill for ralph  
ba57a6d Remove unused purple icons
e12a585 Remove unused icon iterations
e06efcd Use white transparent icon for both favicon and logo
```

No evidence of any Windows workflow-related commits.

## Search Attempts
```bash
$ find . -name "*windows*" -o -name "*test*"
./tests
./tests/test-output-security-fixes
```

No files matching the claimed work found.

## Overall Result: **FAIL**

## Issues Found
1. **File claimed to be modified does not exist**: `.github/workflows/windows-test.yml`
2. **Commit claimed to contain fix does not exist**: `1d402f4`
3. **No evidence of YAML parsing work**: No related commits or file changes
4. **Claims cannot be verified**: Workflow run ID 22243237279 cannot be validated without the workflow file

## Conclusion
The validation request claims work was done on a file that doesn't exist, with a commit that doesn't exist. This represents either:
- Work was done in the wrong repository
- Work was not actually completed as claimed  
- Invalid validation request with incorrect details

**RECOMMENDATION:** Return to `in-progress` status. Work needs to be completed properly with correct file paths and repository location.
