```
**Result:** PASS - Commit exists

### Documentation Review
- Reviewed: docs/TELEMETRY-SYSTEM.md (28KB, 707 lines)
- Comprehensive telemetry system design with:
  - Executive Summary with key goals
  - Architecture overview with ASCII diagram
  - Three pillars of observability (Metrics, Logs, Traces)
  - 40+ metrics defined across 7 categories
  - Logging system design with retention policies
  - 6 collection points documented
  - KPIs and alerting rules
  - 4-phase implementation plan (8 weeks)
  - Technical reference and API examples

### Work Quality Assessment
- TDD methodology followed properly (RED → GREEN)
- Tests written before implementation (0/36 → 36/36)
- Documentation is thorough and well-structured
- Implementation plan includes realistic timeline
- Metrics are well-categorized and comprehensive
- Collection points properly defined
- Integrates well with existing gateway architecture

## Overall Result: PASS

## Issues Found
None. Work meets all acceptance criteria and follows TDD methodology correctly. The telemetry system design is comprehensive and well-integrated with the existing architecture.
