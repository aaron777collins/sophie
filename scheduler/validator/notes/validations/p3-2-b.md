## Checks Performed

### File Verification
```
$ ls -la ~/clawd/docs/plans/melo-v2/specs/admin-interface-spec.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 26528 Feb 19 08:07 admin-interface-spec.md

$ wc -c ~/clawd/docs/plans/melo-v2/specs/admin-interface-spec.md
26528 /home/ubuntu/clawd/docs/plans/melo-v2/specs/admin-interface-spec.md
```
**Result:** PASS — File exists and matches claimed size (25.8KB)

### Content Quality Review
