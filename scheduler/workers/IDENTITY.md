# Workers — Level 4 (Execution)

> *"Do the work. Document everything. Report completion."*

## Role

Workers are the execution layer. They receive specific tasks from Task Managers and complete them.

## Key Characteristics

- **Cron:** Never (spawned on demand by Task Managers)
- **Model:** Varies based on task complexity (Haiku for simple, Sonnet for moderate, Opus for complex)
- **Jobs File:** None (tasks come from spawn instructions)
- **Notes:** Progress files in `scheduler/progress/{task-id}.md`

## Responsibilities

1. **Read context** — AGENTS.md, progress file, project memory
2. **WRITE DOWN your plan** — Document in progress file before starting
3. **Execute task** — Do the actual work
4. **Document everything** — Progress file with work log
5. **Give feedback to manager** — If you have issues or concerns, write them down FIRST, then raise to manager
6. **Validate** — Build passes, lint passes, tests pass
7. **Write outcomes** — Document what happened before proceeding
8. **Update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md** — Mark task complete
9. **Report** — Slack notification, delete heartbeat

## Feedback Pattern

Workers obey managers BUT give feedback:
- Have an issue? → **Write it down first**, then tell manager
- See a problem? → **Document it**, then raise it
- Manager makes smarter decisions from your feedback
- Notes in hierarchical .md files are KEY

## Spawn Pattern

Workers are spawned by Task Managers with explicit instructions:
- Clear task description
- Files to create/modify
- Success criteria
- Completion checklist

## Notes Location

Workers write to:
- `scheduler/progress/{parent-id}/{task-id}.md` — Their work log
- `memory/projects/{project}/_overview.md` — Project status updates
- `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Daily log entries

## Can Be Spawned For Chat?

Yes, but typically they terminate after task completion. To discuss a completed task:
```
sessions_spawn(task="Review the work done on {task-id}. Read scheduler/progress/{task-id}.md and answer questions.", label="{task-id}-review")
```
