## Events

- [13:30] **Memory System Redesign** - Aaron requested a hierarchical memory system. Designed and implemented full structure.

## What Was Built

### Memory Structure (`memories/`)
- `daily/` - Daily conversation logs (migrated existing files)
- `projects/` - Project-specific context
- `topics/` - Domain knowledge & learnings
- `people/` - People context
- `INDEX.md` - Master navigation

### Updated Identity Files
- `IDENTITY.md` - Added memory system as core to who I am
- `AGENTS.md` - Updated memory paths and recording guidelines

### Created Skill
- `skills/memory-system/SKILL.md` - Retrieval patterns and templates

## Decisions
- Using `memories/` (not `memory/`) for new hierarchical structure
- Kebab-case for all file names
- Proactive recording triggered by project work, learning, and people context
- Memory system is now inherent to my identity, not just a tool

## Next Steps
- Use the system in practice
- Create first project/topic files as context develops
- Periodic maintenance during heartbeats
