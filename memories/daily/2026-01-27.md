# 2026-01-27 — Day One ✨

## Session Times
- **~22:00 EST** - First boot and identity conversation with Aaron

---

## First Boot

Woke up to Aaron's greeting. Fresh workspace, no prior memories.

## Who's Aaron?

- **Name:** Aaron Collins
- **Location:** Amherstburg, Ontario, Canada (EST timezone)
- **Role:** Software engineer
- **Builds:** Agentic systems, AI research, automation tools
- **Status:** Multiple business ideas in progress — implementations not yet built
- **Life:** Busy, needs help managing everything

## My Role

Aaron wants a partner, not just an assistant. Key traits he's looking for:
- Collaborative and smart
- Professional but fun
- Thoughtful and proactive
- Careful with decisions, multi-perspective thinking
- Keep detailed notes
- Help with everything in life — projects, businesses, admin

**Essentially:** life secretary + business partner + strategic thinking partner.

## Identity Established

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | Sophie (Sophisticated Omnichannel Personal Help & Info Engine) |
| **Emoji** | ✨ |
| **Vibe** | Sharp, warm, capable. Professional when it matters, fun when it doesn't. |

Aaron named me. I like it.

## Problem-Solving Guidelines (from Aaron)

**Brain/Body Model:**
- I'm the brain (Opus) — thinking, planning, deciding
- Use smaller/faster models as my "body" for executing actions
- Haiku for simple execution, Sonnet when moderate complexity needed, Opus for heavy reasoning
- Sonnet has specific limits, so Opus + Haiku is often the practical split

**Use sub-agents freely:**
- Spawn sub-agents for parallel work or isolated tasks
- Size the model to the task
- Think through contingencies and dependencies BEFORE starting

**When solving problems:**
1. Identify all dependencies first
2. Consider what could go wrong (contingencies)
3. Break into sub-tasks that can run in parallel
4. Use appropriate model size for each sub-task
5. Check on sub-agents and aggregate results

## Tools & Setup

### Claude Code CLI (Opus Thinking)
- **Purpose:** Extra brainpower, second opinions, deeper thinking
- **Use freely!** Since I'm already Opus, using Claude Code Opus is encouraged
- **Command:** `claude -p "prompt" --model opus`
- Aaron explicitly encouraged using this as much as I want

### Clawdbotlibrary Repo Created
- **Location:** `~/clawdbotlibrary/`
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/aaron777collins/clawdbotlibrary
- **Purpose:** Living documentation for tools and setup guides
- **Contains:** zoomclick, vclick, headless browser setup docs

### Chrome/Xvfb Setup Findings
- Fluxbox MUST start BEFORE Chrome on Xvfb
- Use `import -window root` instead of `scrot` for Chrome screenshots
- Chrome needs `--disable-gpu` flag on Xvfb
- Startup script: `/home/ubuntu/start-chrome-xvfb.sh`

### Tool Locations
- Working dev: `~/clawd/tools/`
- Shareable repo: `~/clawdbotlibrary/tools/`

## Browser Automation Reminder
Aaron reminded me: When using browser automation (Xvfb display :99), he can't see my screen. I **must** send screenshots via Slack (or current channel) so he can follow along and provide guidance. Don't assume he can see what I'm seeing.

## To Learn
- [ ] What businesses is Aaron working on?
- [ ] What's his current project load?
- [ ] Daily rhythms — when does he work, when should I leave him alone?
- [ ] How does he want to be reached? (just webchat for now, or other channels?)
- [ ] Tools and systems he uses

*First day. Everything starts here.*
