## Memory System Redesign (~13:30)

Aaron requested a hierarchical memory system. Designed and implemented full structure.

### What Was Built

**Memory Structure (`memories/`)**
| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `daily/` | Conversation logs (migrated existing files) |
| `projects/` | Project-specific context |
| `topics/` | Domain knowledge & learnings |
| `people/` | People context |
| `INDEX.md` | Master navigation |

### Updated Identity Files
- `IDENTITY.md` - Added memory system as core to who I am
- `AGENTS.md` - Updated memory paths and recording guidelines

### Created Skill
- `skills/memory-system/SKILL.md` - Retrieval patterns and templates

### Decisions Made
- Using `memories/` (not `memory/`) for new hierarchical structure
- Kebab-case for all file names
- Proactive recording triggered by project work, learning, and people context
- Memory system is now inherent to my identity, not just a tool

---

## Memory Organization Session (~15:59)

Aaron requested all memories be stored with dates, times, and all relevant information. Asked me to analyze existing topics/projects and update naming to be more specific and clear.

### Issues Found
1. **Date errors** - Files incorrectly dated 2025 instead of 2026
2. **Missing timestamps** - Many entries lacked specific times
3. **No topic files** - Knowledge scattered in daily logs, not extracted
4. **Missing project file** - WYDOT/ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 work not documented
5. **INDEX.md outdated** - Only had one project listed

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Fixed all daily files to use correct 2026 dates
2. ✅ Added timestamps throughout entries where possible
3. ✅ Merged duplicate Jan 27 files into single comprehensive entry
4. ✅ Created topic files:
   - `topics/chrome-xvfb-automation.md` - Browser automation setup
   - `topics/aws-s3-authentication.md` - S3 credential patterns
   - `topics/problem-solving-methodology.md` - Brain/Body model
5. ✅ Created `projects/wydot-connected-driving.md` - Full project documentation
6. ✅ Updated INDEX.md with all projects, topics, and recent logs

### Commit
- **`b21191b`** - feat(memories): reorganize with proper dates, times, and hierarchical structure

## Memory System Now Contains

| Category | Count | Files |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Daily Logs | 4 | 2026-01-27 through 2026-02-01 |
| Projects | 2 | memory-system, wydot-connected-driving |
| Topics | 3 | chrome-xvfb-automation, aws-s3-authentication, problem-solving-methodology |
| People | 0 | (using USER.md for Aaron) |

## Next Steps
- Continue using hierarchical system in practice
- Create topic/project files as new context develops
- Periodic maintenance during heartbeats
- Add people files when meeting/discussing others
