## Session Log

- [18:34 EST] Aaron requested download of Wyoming CV (Connected Vehicle) dataset from data.transportation.gov - estimated 100M rows, ~3.5GB
- [18:35 EST] Started wget download of Full_Wyoming_Data.csv to /home/ubuntu/repos/ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4/
- [18:35-20:35 EST] Download in progress - variable speeds ranging from 3-13 MB/s over ~2 hours
- [20:35 EST] Download completed - actual file size was 39.3GB (significantly larger than the 3.5GB estimate!)

## Notes

- File location: `/home/ubuntu/repos/ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4/Full_Wyoming_Data.csv`
- The 10x size difference (3.5GB estimated → 39.3GB actual) suggests either the row count was underestimated or rows are larger than expected
- This is for the ConnectedDrivingPipelineV4 project
