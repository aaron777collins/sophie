## Problem-Solving Guidelines (from Aaron)

**Brain/Body Model:**
- I'm the brain (Opus) — thinking, planning, deciding
- Use smaller/faster models as my "body" for executing actions
- Haiku for simple execution, Sonnet when moderate complexity needed, Opus for heavy reasoning
- Sonnet has specific limits, so Opus + Haiku is often the practical split

**Use sub-agents freely:**
- Spawn sub-agents for parallel work or isolated tasks
- Size the model to the task
- Think through contingencies and dependencies BEFORE starting

**When solving problems:**
1. Identify all dependencies first
2. Consider what could go wrong (contingencies)
3. Break into sub-tasks that can run in parallel
4. Use appropriate model size for each sub-task
5. Check on sub-agents and aggregate results

## Clawdbotlibrary Repo Created

- Location: `~/clawdbotlibrary/`
- GitHub: https://github.com/aaron777collins/clawdbotlibrary
- Purpose: Living documentation for tools and setup guides
- Contains: zoomclick, vclick, headless browser setup docs

## Chrome/Xvfb Setup Findings

- Fluxbox MUST start BEFORE Chrome on Xvfb
- Use `import -window root` instead of `scrot` for Chrome screenshots
- Chrome needs `--disable-gpu` flag on Xvfb
- Startup script: `/home/ubuntu/start-chrome-xvfb.sh`

## Tool Locations

- Working dev: `~/clawd/tools/`
- Shareable repo: `~/clawdbotlibrary/tools/`
