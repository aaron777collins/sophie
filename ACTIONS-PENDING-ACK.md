# Actions Pending Acknowledgment

**Purpose:** All automatic external actions Sophie takes are logged here.
**Rule:** Items are ONLY removed when Aaron acknowledges them.

---

## Pending Acknowledgment

*Actions taken that Aaron hasn't acknowledged yet*

| Date | Action | Context | Status |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| *No pending actions* | | | |

---

## How This Works

1. **Sophie takes any external action** → Logs it here with timestamp
2. **Sophie reports to Aaron** → In Slack or wherever
3. **Aaron acknowledges** → "ack" or similar
4. **Sophie removes from this list** → Only after acknowledgment

---

## Action Types That Get Logged

- Responding to emails (even drafts sent for review)
- Responding to GitHub issues/PRs
- Any external communication
- System changes affecting external services
- Anything that could affect others

---

## Recently Acknowledged

*Last 10 acknowledged actions (for reference)*

| Date | Action | Acknowledged |
|------|--------|--------------|
| *None yet* | | |

## Notes

- [2026-02-27 01:58 EST] System created per Aaron's directive
- If Aaron wasn't okay with an action, we catch it here before it's forgotten
- This is a safety net — we don't want to do things Aaron wouldn't approve
