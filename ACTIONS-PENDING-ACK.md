# Actions Pending Acknowledgment

**Purpose:** All automatic external actions Sophie takes are logged here.

## How This Works

1. **Sophie takes any external action** → Logs it here with timestamp
2. **Sophie reports to Aaron** → In Slack or wherever
3. **Aaron acknowledges** → "ack" or similar
4. **Sophie removes from this list** → Only after acknowledgment

## Notes

- [2026-02-27 01:58 EST] System created per Aaron's directive
- If Aaron wasn't okay with an action, we catch it here before it's forgotten
- This is a safety net — we don't want to do things Aaron wouldn't approve
