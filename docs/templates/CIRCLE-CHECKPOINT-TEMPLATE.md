# Circle Checkpoint Template

**Date:** [FILL IN DATE]  
**Checkpoint ID:** [UNIQUE IDENTIFIER, e.g., CP-2026-001]  
**Project:** [PROJECT NAME]  
**Phase:** [PROJECT PHASE OR MILESTONE]  
**Decision Point:** [SPECIFIC DECISION OR APPROVAL NEEDED]

## Usage Instructions

This template provides a structured approach for conducting formal Circle checkpoints at critical decision gates. Use this when a major decision requires approval to proceed to the next phase.

**When to Use This Template:**
- Project phase transitions (initiation → planning → execution → deployment)
- Major resource allocation decisions  
- Go/no-go decisions for significant initiatives
- Risk escalation points requiring management review
- Quality gate evaluations before major deliverables
- Strategic pivot or direction change decisions

**How to Use:**
1. Complete trigger criteria to confirm checkpoint is needed
2. Conduct Circle analysis using integrated perspectives
3. Document evaluation results and recommendation
4. Make formal decision with rationale
5. Define follow-up actions and monitoring plan
6. Archive in project memory for future reference

## Example Checkpoint Usage

### Sample: Database Migration Go/No-Go Decision

**Decision:** Proceed with MySQL to PostgreSQL migration

**Circle Evaluation Summary:**
- **Pragmatist:** 4/5 - Team ready, plan solid, reasonable timeline
- **Skeptic:** 3/5 - Concerned about data integrity during migration
- **Guardian:** 5/5 - Security improvements justify effort
- **Dreamer:** 4/5 - Enables future analytics and ML capabilities

**Decision:** GO - Proceed with migration using phased approach

**Key Mitigations:** Extra data validation checkpoints (Skeptic concern)
