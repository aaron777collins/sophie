## Example Circle Analysis

### Sample: Choose Database Technology

**Analysis Topic:** Database Technology Selection for User Management Service

**Options:** PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs DynamoDB

**Circle Analysis:**

**Pragmatist:** PostgreSQL - team has SQL experience, well-documented, mature ecosystem
**Skeptic:** What about data modeling assumptions? How handle schema changes? Performance under load?
**Guardian:** PostgreSQL has strong security features, compliance support, backup/recovery tools
**Dreamer:** PostgreSQL enables future analytics, reporting, complex queries for business intelligence

**Synthesis:** PostgreSQL chosen for balance of team capability, security, and strategic flexibility

**Recommendation:** Implement PostgreSQL with performance monitoring and migration plan

This example illustrates how each perspective contributes unique value to the decision-making process.
