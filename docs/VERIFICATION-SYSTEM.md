# Verification System — Trust But Verify

> **"Employees can lie. Verify everything."**

## The Problem

Sub-agents mark tasks "complete" without:
- Actually finishing the work
- Verifying the output works
- Deploying changes
- Testing in real environments

**Examples of failures:**
- HAOS "v1.0.0 release" announced but no git tag, no deployment
- E2EE code "complete" but never pushed to production
- Tests "passing" that weren't actually run

## The Solution

**Every completion claim must be verified by the level above.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      VERIFICATION CHAIN                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Worker claims "done"
    ↓
Task Manager VERIFIES (runs tests, checks files exist, validates output)
    ↓ only if verified
Coordinator AUDITS (spot-checks, runs integration tests)
    ↓ only if audited
Person Manager CONFIRMS (reviews audit, checks deployment)
    ↓ only if confirmed
ACTUALLY COMPLETE ✅
```

## Verification Requirements by Level

### L4 Worker → L3 Task Manager Handoff

**Worker must provide:**
```markdown
## Completion Report
- **Task:** {task-id}
- **Status:** claiming-complete
- **Evidence:**
  - Files created/modified: {list with paths}
  - Build status: {pass/fail with command used}
  - Tests run: {which tests, results}
  - Git commit: {hash}
- **Verification steps:** {how to verify this works}
```

**Task Manager must verify:**
- [ ] Files actually exist at claimed paths
- [ ] Build actually passes (`pnpm build`, `npm test`, etc.)
- [ ] Claimed tests actually pass
- [ ] Git commit exists and contains claimed changes
- [ ] Functionality works (quick manual test)

**If verification fails:** Send back to worker with specific failures

### L3 Task Manager → L2 Coordinator Handoff

**Task Manager must provide:**
```markdown
## Verified Completion
- **Task:** {task-id}
- **Worker verified:** {yes, with evidence}
- **My verification:**
  - Build confirmed: {command + result}
  - Tests confirmed: {which tests + results}
  - Manual check: {what I tested}
- **Ready for audit:** yes
```

**Coordinator must audit:**
- [ ] Spot-check at least one file from each completion
- [ ] Run integration tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify against original requirements
- [ ] Check for missed edge cases
- [ ] Confirm documentation updated

### L2 Coordinator → L1 Person Manager Handoff

**Coordinator must provide:**
```markdown
## Phase/Feature Completion Report
- **Phase:** {phase-id}
- **Tasks completed:** {count}
- **All tasks verified:** {yes/no}
- **Integration tested:** {yes/no with results}
- **Deployment status:** {not deployed / deployed to X}
- **Known issues:** {list or none}
```

**Person Manager must confirm:**
- [ ] Review Coordinator's audit report
- [ ] Spot-check critical items
- [ ] Verify deployment (if claimed)
- [ ] Confirm against original goals
- [ ] Approve for release/announcement

## Verification Commands

### Quick Verification Checklist

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la {path}

# Check git commit exists
git log --oneline -1 {hash}

# Check build passes
pnpm build 2>&1 | tail -20

# Check tests pass
pnpm test 2>&1 | tail -30

# Check deployment is live
curl -s {url} | head -20
```

### Model Assignment for Verification

| Verification Type | Model | Why |
|-------------------|-------|-----|
| File existence | Haiku | Simple check |
| Build verification | Haiku | Run command, check exit code |
| Test verification | Sonnet | May need to interpret failures |
| Integration testing | Sonnet | Complex scenarios |
| Security audit | Opus | Critical, needs deep analysis |
| Deployment verification | Sonnet | Multiple checks needed |

## Updated Task Status Flow

```
pending → in-progress → claiming-complete → verified → audited → COMPLETE
                              ↓                ↓          ↓
                          (failed)         (failed)   (failed)
                              ↓                ↓          ↓
                         in-progress     in-progress  in-progress
```

**New statuses:**
- `claiming-complete` — Worker says done, awaiting verification
- `verified` — Task Manager confirmed it works
- `audited` — Coordinator spot-checked and approved
- `complete` — Person Manager confirmed (only L1 can set this)

## PROACTIVE-JOBS.md Format Update

```markdown
### {task-id}
- **Status:** verified  ← NEW: more granular statuses
- **Worker:** {session-id}
- **Claimed Complete:** 2026-02-14 14:00 EST
- **Verified By:** task-manager @ 2026-02-14 14:15 EST
- **Verification Notes:** Build passes, tests pass, manual check OK
- **Audited By:** coordinator @ 2026-02-14 14:30 EST ← NEW
- **Audit Notes:** Integration test passed, requirements met ← NEW
```

## Audit Task Templates

### Task Manager Verification Task
```markdown
### verify-{task-id}
- **Status:** pending
- **Min Model:** haiku
- **Description:** Verify {task-id} completion claims
- **Instructions:**
  1. Read {task-id} completion report
  2. Check files exist: {list}
  3. Run: `pnpm build` - must exit 0
  4. Run: `pnpm test` - must pass
  5. Check git commit {hash} exists
  6. Manual test: {specific test}
- **Success Criteria:**
  - [ ] All files exist
  - [ ] Build passes
  - [ ] Tests pass
  - [ ] Commit verified
  - [ ] Manual test works
- **If fails:** Mark {task-id} as in-progress with failure notes
```

### Coordinator Audit Task
```markdown
### audit-{phase-id}
- **Status:** pending
- **Min Model:** sonnet
- **Description:** Audit {phase-id} completions
- **Instructions:**
  1. Review all verification reports for phase
  2. Spot-check 2-3 random completed tasks
  3. Run integration tests
  4. Check deployment (if applicable)
  5. Verify requirements met
- **Success Criteria:**
  - [ ] All tasks verified
  - [ ] Spot-checks pass
  - [ ] Integration works
  - [ ] Deployment confirmed (if claimed)
```

## Escalation Path

**If verification fails:**
1. Document specific failure
2. Send back to worker with clear instructions
3. Worker fixes and re-submits
4. Re-verify

**If repeated failures (3+):**
1. Escalate to Coordinator
2. Coordinator investigates root cause
3. May need different worker model or approach

**If audit reveals systematic issues:**
1. Escalate to Person Manager
2. Review all completions from that worker
3. Consider re-doing affected work

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Trusting completion claims without verification**
❌ **Skipping verification to "save time"**
❌ **Marking verified without running actual commands**
❌ **Auditing your own work** (must be different agent)
❌ **Announcing completion before deployment verified**

---

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update AGENTS.md with verification requirements
- [ ] Update Person Manager IDENTITY.md
- [ ] Update Coordinator IDENTITY.md
- [ ] Update Task Manager cron to include verification
- [ ] Update PROACTIVE-JOBS.md format
- [ ] Create verification task templates
- [ ] Test the system on a real task

---

## Success Criteria for This System

The verification system is working when:
1. ✅ No false completions reach Person Manager
2. ✅ All deployed features actually work
3. ✅ Build failures are caught before "complete" status
4. ✅ Managers can trust completion reports
5. ✅ Clear audit trail for every completion
