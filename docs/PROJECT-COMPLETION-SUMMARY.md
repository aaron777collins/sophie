## Testing Requirements Implementation

### TDD Methodology (Mandatory for All Work)
Every task must follow Test-Driven Development:

1. **RED Phase:** Write tests first (they should fail initially)
2. **GREEN Phase:** Implement just enough to make tests pass  
3. **REFACTOR Phase:** Improve implementation while keeping tests green

### Testing Framework Integration by Work Type
| Work Type | Testing Tools | Validation Method | Evidence Required |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Documentation | Validation scripts, link checkers | Structure validation | Test output, reports |
| Frontend Code | Jest, Playwright, Cypress | Unit + E2E testing | Coverage reports, screenshots |
| Backend Code | Jest, Supertest, integration tests | API + DB validation | Test results, logs |
| Infrastructure | Terraform plan, smoke tests | Deployment validation | Plan output, logs |
| Content/Media | Accessibility checks, format validation | Quality compliance | Validation reports |

### Quality Gates (Cannot Be Bypassed)
- **Layer 1 (Self):** Test evidence required before claiming completion
- **Layer 2 (Manager):** Test quality verification before approval  
- **Layer 3 (Validator):** Independent test execution before final approval
- **No exceptions:** Tasks without test evidence are automatically rejected

## Validation Workflow Enhancement

### 3-Layer Validation System
**Enhanced from basic approval to comprehensive testing validation:**

#### Layer 1: Self-Validation (Worker)
- Tests written BEFORE implementation (TDD RED phase)
- All tests passing (TDD GREEN phase)  
- Code refactored while maintaining tests (TDD REFACTOR phase)
- Testing evidence collected (logs, screenshots, coverage)
- Cannot claim complete without test evidence

#### Layer 2: Manager Validation (Coordinator)  
- Verify test evidence provided (logs, screenshots, coverage)
- Confirm tests actually validate acceptance criteria
- Check test coverage meets requirements
- Validate proper testing framework usage
- Cannot approve without reviewing test results

#### Layer 3: Independent Validation (Validator)
- Run tests independently to confirm results
- Verify test quality and comprehensiveness
- Check for missed edge cases or requirements
- Validate end-to-end functionality works
- Final approval requires independent test verification

## Circle Critical Thinking Integration

### Framework Implementation
**Four Perspectives Integrated Throughout Planning:**
- **🔧 Pragmatist:** Resource planning, timeline feasibility, technical constraints
- **🔍 Skeptic:** Risk identification, edge cases, potential failure points  
- **🛡️ Guardian:** Security assessment, compliance, risk mitigation
- **🌟 Dreamer:** Innovation opportunities, future potential, vision alignment

### Circle Weight Levels
| Level | When Used | Token Cost | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 💭 Internal | Routine decisions | Minimal | Quick perspective check |
| 🟢 Light | Moderate stakes | Low | Structured analysis |
| 🟡 Standard | Important decisions | Medium | Comprehensive evaluation |
| 🟠 Elevated | High-stakes choices | High | Deep critical analysis |
| 🔴 Counsel | Critical/irreversible | Highest | Maximum rigor analysis |

### Checkpoint Integration
**Mandatory checkpoints** (must use Circle analysis):
- Epic planning and breakdown
- Architecture decisions  
- Technology selection
- Risk assessment
- Resource allocation
