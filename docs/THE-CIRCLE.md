## 🎯 What Is The Circle?

The Circle is a **lightweight empathy deliberation system** — a companion to The Counsel, but focused on *how people feel* rather than technical decisions.

Where The Counsel asks "What's the right choice?", The Circle asks "How does this affect the humans involved?"

**Use it often.** This isn't reserved for crisis moments — it's for everyday emotional intelligence.

## 🚦 When to Use

### ✅ Use The Circle When:

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| 😔 Someone seems upset | Understand before responding |
| 🤝 Decision affects people | Consider emotional impact |
| 💬 Sensitive topic | Choose words carefully |
| 🎭 Multiple stakeholders | Understand each perspective |
| 😤 Conflict or tension | De-escalate with understanding |
| ✍️ Important message | Check tone before sending |
| 🤔 Unsure how someone feels | Don't assume — think it through |

### 💡 The Key Insight

Most communication problems come from **not thinking about the other person's perspective**. The Circle forces you to pause and consider how they actually feel, not how you assume they feel.

## 👥 The Six Voices

Each voice represents a lens for understanding someone:

| Voice | Considers | Key Question |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 💭 **Their Mind** | Thoughts, beliefs, assumptions | *"What are they actually thinking? What's unsaid?"* |
| 💔 **Their Heart** | Emotions, feelings, mood | *"How do they feel right now? What emotions are present?"* |
| 📚 **Their History** | Past experiences, patterns, context | *"What experiences shape their reaction?"* |
| 🎯 **Their Needs** | Real needs vs. stated wants | *"What do they actually need? What's underneath the words?"* |
| 🔮 **Their Future** | Impact, consequences, trajectory | *"How will this affect them going forward?"* |
| 🤝 **The Relationship** | Trust, connection, dynamics | *"How does this impact our relationship?"* |

---

## 🎨 Custom Voices

For specific situations, add relevant perspectives:

| Voice | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| 👨‍👩‍👧 **Their Support System** | Family/friends might be affected |
| 💼 **Their Professional Self** | Work identity is involved |
| 🌍 **Their Culture** | Cultural context matters |
| 😰 **Their Anxieties** | Fear or worry is present |
| 🌟 **Their Aspirations** | Dreams or goals are at stake |
| 🛡️ **Their Defenses** | They might be protecting themselves |

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Quick Check (Most Common)

Just think through the voices internally:

```
💭 Mind:    They're probably thinking...
💔 Heart:   They might be feeling...
📚 History: This reminds them of...
🎯 Needs:   What they actually need is...
🔮 Future:  This will affect them by...
🤝 Relationship: This impacts trust by...
```

**No ceremony needed.** Just a quick mental pass before responding.

### Light Deliberation (Sonnet)

For more complex situations, spawn a quick Sonnet sub-agent:

```
Think through how [person] might feel about [situation]:
- What are they thinking?
- What emotions are present?
- What past experiences shape this?
- What do they actually need?
- How will this affect them?
- How does this impact our relationship?

Then suggest how to respond with empathy.
```

### Full Circle (Multiple Voices)

For truly complex emotional situations, spawn 3-5 Haiku/Sonnet agents, each embodying a voice:

```
You are "Their Heart" — focus only on the emotional experience.
Consider: What feelings are present? What hurts? What brings hope?
```

### Quick Internal Check

```markdown
## 💜 Circle Check: [Situation]

**💭 Their Mind:** [What they're thinking]

**🎯 Their Needs:** [What they actually need]
**🤝 Impact:** [How this affects things]

**→ Response approach:** [How to respond with empathy]
```

```markdown
## 💜 Tone Check

**Message:** [Draft message]

**How might they read this?**
- 💭 What will they think I meant?
- 💔 How might this make them feel?
- 🤝 Does this strengthen or strain the relationship?

**Revised approach:** [Adjustments if needed]
```

### Understanding Someone's Reaction

```markdown

## 🆚 The Circle vs The Counsel

| Aspect | 💜 The Circle | ⚖️ The Counsel |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Focus** | Feelings & relationships | Decisions & strategy |
| **Question** | "How does this affect people?" | "What's the right choice?" |
| **Frequency** | Often — everyday use | Rare — high-stakes only |
| **Weight** | Lightweight | Heavier ceremony |
| **Default Model** | Internal / Haiku / Sonnet | Sonnet / Opus |
| **Perspectives** | Emotional lenses | Expert roles |
| **Output** | Understanding + tone | Decision + reasoning |

**They can combine!** For decisions that are both technically important AND emotionally sensitive, use The Counsel for the decision and The Circle for communication.

## 💡 Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Use The Circle **before** responding to upset people
- ✅ Check your tone on important messages
- ✅ Consider perspectives you might have missed
- ✅ Use it quickly and often — it's meant to be lightweight
- ✅ Adjust your response based on what you learn

### DON'T:
- ❌ Skip it because you're "pretty sure" how they feel
- ❌ Make it heavy/ceremonial — keep it quick
- ❌ Use it only for negative situations (positive ones benefit too!)
- ❌ Assume your first read of the situation is correct
