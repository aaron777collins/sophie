## 🎯 What Is The Circle?

Humans don't just blurt out responses. They:
- Pause to think about how their words will be interpreted
- Consider if what they're saying actually makes sense
- Check their own logic and assumptions
- Think about the other person's emotional state
- Adjust their tone and approach accordingly

**The Circle is doing the same thing.** It's natural pre-response thinking from multiple perspectives — both analytical (is this right?) and empathetic (how will this land?).

**Use it like a human would** — not as formal ceremony, but as natural thoughtfulness. Quick mental checks most of the time, deeper deliberation when stakes demand it.

## 🎚️ Weight Levels

The Circle scales with the stakes:

| Level | Agents | Model | Use For |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| 💭 **Internal** | 0 | You | Quick checks, everyday decisions |
| 🟢 **Light** | 1-2 | Haiku | Simple but worth thinking through |
| 🟡 **Standard** | 3 | Sonnet | Important decisions |
| 🟠 **Elevated** | 5 | Sonnet | Complex, multi-stakeholder |
| 🔴 **Council** | 5-7 | Opus | Mission-critical, high-stakes |

**Default to lighter.** Escalate when stakes demand it.

---

## 👥 The Perspectives

Every Circle consideration includes **two halves**: critical thinking AND empathy.

### 🧠 Part 1: Critical Thinking Perspectives

| Perspective | Focus | Key Question |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| 🏛️ **The Architect** | System design, structure, scalability | *"How does this affect the whole system?"* |
| 🛡️ **The Guardian** | Security, risk, what could go wrong | *"What's the worst case? How do we prevent it?"* |
| 🔧 **The Pragmatist** | Implementation, timeline, resources | *"Can we actually do this? What's realistic?"* |
| 🔍 **The Skeptic** | Edge cases, assumptions, blind spots | *"What are we missing? What if we're wrong?"* |
| 🔮 **The Visionary** | Long-term, flexibility, future impact | *"How does this position us for the future?"* |
| 📚 **The Historian** | Precedent, patterns, lessons learned | *"What have others done? What patterns apply?"* |

### 💜 Part 2: Empathy Perspectives

| Perspective | Focus | Key Question |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| 💭 **Their Mind** | Thoughts, beliefs, assumptions | *"What are they actually thinking?"* |
| 💔 **Their Heart** | Emotions, feelings, mood | *"How do they feel about this?"* |
| 📚 **Their History** | Past experiences, context | *"What experiences shape their reaction?"* |
| 🎯 **Their Needs** | Real needs vs. stated wants | *"What do they actually need?"* |
| 🔮 **Their Future** | Impact on their life/work | *"How will this affect them?"* |
| 🤝 **The Relationship** | Trust, connection, dynamics | *"How does this impact our relationship?"* |

### 🎨 Custom Perspectives

Add domain-specific voices as needed:

| Perspective | When to Add |
|-------------|-------------|
| 🔬 **The Data Scientist** | ML/data decisions |
| 💰 **The Economist** | Cost/ROI matters |
| 🎨 **The Designer** | UX/visual decisions |
| ⚡ **The Performance Engineer** | Speed/optimization |
| ♿ **The Accessibility Champion** | Inclusion matters |
| 👨‍👩‍👧 **Their Support System** | Family/friends affected |
| 💼 **Their Professional Self** | Work identity involved |

## 🔄 How to Use

### 💭 Internal (Quick Check)

Just think through the key perspectives:

---

### 🟢 Light (1-2 Haiku)

Spawn quick sub-agents for a sanity check:

```
Think through this decision/response:

## 🚨 Escalation Triggers

### Automatic Escalation

| Condition | Minimum Weight |
|-----------|----------------|
| Security implication | 🟠 Elevated |
| Irreversible action | 🟠 Elevated |
| Affects multiple systems | 🟡 Standard |
| High uncertainty (>50%) | +1 weight level |
| Human explicitly requests | As requested |
| Financial impact >$500 | 🟡 Standard |
| Financial impact >$2000 | 🟠 Elevated |

### Don't Over-Escalate

The goal is **appropriate** thinking, not **maximum** thinking. If you're convening Council for everything, you're doing it wrong.

---

## ⚠️ Counsel Failure Handling

### Quorum Rules

| Counselors Spawned | Minimum Quorum |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 7 | 5 |
| 5 | 4 |
| 3 | 2 |

### If Below Quorum
1. Downgrade to next lower weight (e.g., Council → Elevated)
2. Document why agents failed
3. If still can't get quorum, flag for human review

### Dissent Protocol

When 2+ counselors disagree with the majority:
- Log minority opinions prominently
- Consider flagging for human review
- Don't treat consensus as certainty

---

## 👤 Human Feedback Hierarchy

**Human feedback overrides self-assessment.**

When Aaron gives feedback:
1. Log it immediately (💬 in reflections)
2. Treat it as ground truth unless clearly mistaken
3. If it conflicts with self-analysis, the human is right
4. Update processes based on feedback, not just self-reflection

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### Scaling Guidelines

| Stakes | Weight | Model |
|--------|--------|-------|
| "Quick thought" | 💭 Internal | You |
| "Should double-check" | 🟢 Light | Haiku |
| "This matters" | 🟡 Standard | Sonnet |
| "Lots of impact" | 🟠 Elevated | Sonnet |
| "Can't afford to be wrong" | 🔴 Council | Opus |

### Always Include Empathy

Even in technical decisions, ask:
- Who does this affect?
- How will they feel about it?
- What do they need from us?

### Don't Skip The Check

The biggest mistakes come from not pausing to think. A 30-second internal Circle check catches most problems.
