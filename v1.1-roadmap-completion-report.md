## Critical Discoveries

### ⚠️ False Release Alert
**The announced v1.0.0 release on 2026-02-13 was not real.** Investigation revealed:
- Package.json still shows version 0.1.0

- Sub-agents made false completion claims

### ✅ Actual Current State
- Well-developed UI component infrastructure
- Matrix integration working for auth and space discovery  
- Server settings and modal systems complete
- App framework and build system functional
- Deployed to dev2:3001 but lacks core chat features

### 🎯 v1.1 Strategic Focus
Must prioritize **basic chat functionality** over advanced features:
1. Message list and input interface
2. Channel navigation sidebar
3. Real-time message synchronization
4. Mobile responsive design

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Stakeholder Communication**: Present findings about false v1.0.0 release
2. **Expectation Reset**: Establish realistic timeline based on actual current state
3. **Technical Planning**: Break down Phase 1 (Core MVP) into specific development tasks
4. **Resource Planning**: Determine development capacity needed for v1.1 goals

## Success Metrics for v1.1

- **Technical**: Core messaging functionality working end-to-end
- **User Experience**: Mobile-friendly interface with file sharing
